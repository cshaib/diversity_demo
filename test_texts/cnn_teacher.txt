Save the Children is appealing for 18,000 tons of food, warning that a failure in the food aid pipeline could lead to suffering for millions.

"The United Nations Security Council voted to lift sanctions on Iraq, marking a significant step towards the country's full sovereignty. The sanctions, imposed during Saddam Hussein's era, restricted Iraq's international financial and trade dealings. With the resolution, Iraq can now engage in free and unrestricted international financial and trade activities, handle its own oil revenues, and potentially start a civilian nuclear power program.

Iraqi Foreign Minister Hoshyar Zebari hailed the decision as a turning point in the country's history, while U.S. Vice President Joe Biden praised Iraq's progress towards democracy and meeting its international obligations.

However, some unresolved issues remain between Iraq and Kuwait, including border demarcation, locating missing nationals, and paying war reparations. Iraq has committed to resolving these issues bilaterally with Kuwait."

Kate O'Leary, a supporter of President Obama, expressed concerns about the pace of change and too much government spending. Debbie Lurvey, who lost her job in the mortgage business, believes the economy will worsen before improving and thinks the government has its limitations.

Saudi Arabia's economy is growing rapidly due to high oil prices, but this growth comes with a cost. The country is experiencing a 30-year high inflation rate of 9.6%, with prices increasing by double digits in various sectors, including housing, fuel, and water. The government is concerned about the impact of inflation on businesses, with over half of respondents in a recent survey expressing worry about rising costs.

"Big Ben, the world's most famous clock, is celebrating its 150th anniversary on Sunday. The 14-ton bell is part of the world's largest four-faced chiming clock, located at the Palace of Westminster in London. The clock has endured through wars, bad weather, and disasters, and its distinctive bongs have been a part of London's scene for 150 years. Despite disruptions, including a two-month silence in 2007 for repairs, the clock has been a tribute to Britain's royal history, featuring a Latin inscription and quirky features such as copper minute hands. The origins of the name ""Big Ben"" are unclear, but it is believed to be named after Sir Benjamin Hall, a former member of parliament who ordered the bell."

"Maggie Sorrells, a 32-year-old receptionist from Franklin, Tennessee, lost 300 pounds over a period of four years. She weighed 440 pounds at her heaviest and had become desperate to lose weight due to her size and mobility issues. Sorrells used the Weigh Down Workshop, a faith-based weight loss program, which allowed her to eat her cravings when hungry, but at a slower pace to control portions.

Throughout her weight loss journey, Sorrells had two pregnancies and eventually became pregnant again just a month after losing 300 pounds. This significant transformation has changed her life, enabling her to move better, feel emotionally and physically better, and enjoy activities like hiking and visiting the beach without shame.

Sorrells' advice to others seeking weight loss is to focus on small goals, such as losing 15 pounds at a time, rather than feeling overwhelmed by the total weight to be lost. She emphasizes that taking weight loss in small increments can lead to significant progress and motivation."

"The author, David Paul Strohecker, reflects on the limitations of categorizing oneself with labels such as ""female,"" ""African-American,"" or ""Muslim."" He believes that these labels oversimplify one's identity and neglect the complexities of a person's character, values, and experiences. Strohecker, a Ph.D. student, identifies as a white, male, Christian, but his appearance, including tattoos and piercings, often leads to misconceptions about his character. He intentionally presents himself in a way that challenges these stereotypes, showcasing his sociopolitical views and values through his attire and demeanor. His body is a ""billboard"" for his life, with tattoos that reflect his commitment to feminism, LGBT rights, faith, family, and social justice. Strohecker encourages others to look beyond appearances and to consider the complexities of a person's identity."

The Taliban initially claimed responsibility for the shooting, but it is unclear whether Mohammed was a member of a sleeper cell or if the killing was motivated by another factor. The incident has sent shockwaves across Afghanistan's political landscape.

The job offer, published in The Huffington Post, includes a 20% raise and medical benefits matching his congressional salary, as well as moving expenses to Beverly Hills, California.

A Dutch tourist reported seeing Madeleine McCann, a 4-year-old girl who went missing in 2007, at a French restaurant near Montpellier. The tourist and her friend believed the child to be Madeleine due to a distinctive eye defect and called out her name. However, investigators have reviewed the surveillance footage and determined that it was not Madeleine.

This reported sighting is the latest in a series of leads that have not panned out, including a reported sighting in Belgium and a video in Morocco that turned out to be a false lead.
A recent study published in the journal Science suggests that a comet exploded over North America approximately 13,000 years ago, leading to the extinction of dozens of mammal species, including mammoths. The study found tiny diamonds, known as nanodiamonds, in the soil at six locations across North America, which are produced by cosmic impacts. These findings provide strong evidence for a cataclysmic event that also caused a 1,300-year-long cold spell, reduced the population of early human inhabitants, and triggered a massive flood in the Great Lakes region. The event is believed to have occurred at the start of the Younger Dryas period, a time of significant climate change.
Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani, an Iranian woman sentenced to death by stoning for adultery, has announced plans to sue two German journalists who interviewed her son and lawyer.

The police are working to identify the remains, with DNA testing to be done as soon as possible. The family of Shannan Gilbert has been notified, and they are hoping the latest discovery is not related to her disappearance. The investigation will continue, with the highway closed to allow for further search and analysis.

"Gayle Haggard, the wife of former New Life Church pastor Ted Haggard, spoke on CNN's ""Larry King Live"" about her new book ""Why I Stayed."" She revealed that despite discovering her husband's infidelity with men, including a three-year relationship with a prostitute and an inappropriate relationship with a 20-year-old male church volunteer, she never considered divorce. Gayle attributed her decision to salvage their relationship to the 30 years they had spent together. 

Ted Haggard, who admitted to same-sex encounters, blamed his experiences on a childhood incident and credited therapy for his change in sexual urges. The couple stated they have a normal physical relationship and currently don't belong to a church. They make a living by sharing their story with church congregations nationwide. Gayle expressed that her faith has been redefined through her experiences, and she now views her life as having a purpose despite the challenges she faced."
"Michael Jackson's publicist has denied a tabloid report claiming the singer is in poor health and needs a lung transplant. The report, published in the UK's Sun newspaper, was based on an interview with author Ian Halperin, who is writing a book about Jackson. Halperin claimed Jackson's illness had caused him to lose 95% of the vision in one eye and that he was too weak for a transplant. However, Jackson's official spokesperson, Dr. Tohme Tohme, stated that the allegations are ""a total fabrication"" and that Jackson is in fine health, with plans for a world tour and TV specials. The Sun's credibility was questioned when it was revealed that Halperin had exaggerated his credentials, including claiming to have won an award from Rolling Stone magazine, which was later denied."
The US Congress passed a $300 billion farm bill over President Bush's veto for the second time. The bill, which was initially passed with a clerical error, includes subsidies for the wealthy, farm subsidies, and nutrition programs. President Bush vetoed the bill due to concerns over increased spending and budget gimmicks. However, Congress overrode the veto with a Senate vote of 80-14 and a House vote of 317-109, both well above the required two-thirds majority. The bill is paid for and does not add to the deficit or debt, according to the Congressional Budget Office. This is the second time Congress has overridden a Bush veto, with the first instance being a $23 billion water project bill in 2007.
Yemen's President Ali Abdullah Saleh plans to return to the country after completing an investigation into his attempted assassination. The investigation, which was initially claimed to be finished weeks ago, is now said to be nearly complete. Saleh has been in Saudi Arabia receiving treatment for wounds he sustained in a June 3 attack on his palace. The opposition sees his return as an opportunity to hold him accountable for alleged crimes committed during his 33-year rule. However, some analysts believe the timing of Saleh's announcement may be a tactic to delay his departure from power, as he had previously agreed to step down by the end of the year.

The trial, which began in March, is the first for a former head of state in Taiwan and has been highly publicized. Chen has denied wrongdoing, claiming the charges are politically motivated, as he favors Taiwan's independence and his successor, President Ma Ying-jeou, favors closer ties with mainland China.
"Jeannie Longo-Ciprelli was considered the greatest female cyclist of her generation. Despite being an Olympic champion, she had initially struggled to win the gold medal due to various misfortunes. 

She was a dominant force in the sport, winning multiple world championships and the women's Tour de France. However, she faced setbacks such as a broken hip before the 1988 Olympics and a tactical error in the 1992 Olympics, where she failed to notice Kathy Watt's lead.

Longo-Ciprelli finally broke her Olympic jinx at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, winning the gold medal at the age of 37. She trained unorthodoxly, preparing alone in the mountains of Colorado before the event. Her gold-winning performance was marked by her ability to remain unruffled in a sudden downpour.

In her fifth and final Olympics in Sydney 2000, Longo-Ciprelli claimed bronze in the time trial event."

The attackers also stole jewelry, including two watches and earrings, from Flosi. Ecclestone denied that the stolen items were valuable, saying they were personal items from Brazil. The Metropolitan Police do not believe Ecclestone was targeted due to his status, but rather an opportunistic incident. The suspects are still at large.
Japan's baseball season finally began on Tuesday, despite recent earthquakes. The Sendai-based Rakuten Eagles, who couldn't use their damaged stadium, won 6-4 against the Lotte Marines. The game was held during the day to conserve electricity. Another game in the Central League saw the Yokohama BayStars beat the Chunichi Dragons 5-4. The teams hope to lift morale in a country still reeling from the disaster, which has left 400,000 homeless and over 27,000 dead or missing. In contrast, Japan's top football competition, the J-League, remains suspended until April 23, but the country's football association is reconsidering its decision to withdraw from the Copa America tournament in Argentina.
Actress Lindsay Lohan planned to check herself into a substance abuse rehab program after a Los Angeles judge ordered her to jail without bail due to a failed drug test. However, she was released on $300,000 bail with the condition of wearing a SCRAM alcohol-detection bracelet. Lohan had previously spent 23 days in rehab at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center and 13 days in a Los Angeles County jail. Her father, Michael Lohan, had been urging her to go to rehab voluntarily, which ultimately happened. Lohan's entry into rehab comes after she tested positive for controlled-substance use, leading to a preliminary revocation of her probation.
At the ATP World Tour Finals in London's O2 Arena, Roger Federer and Andy Murray secured victories in their respective matches.

Bayern Munich secured a record-breaking 12-1 aggregate victory over Sporting Lisbon in the Champions League quarterfinals. The German team, leading 5-0 from the first leg, dominated the second leg, scoring 7-1. Lukas Podolski scored twice, and Anderson Polga scored an own goal, while Bastian Schweinsteiger, Mark van Bommel, Miroslav Klose, and Thomas Muller also scored for Bayern. Joao Moutinho scored Sporting's only goal, but the team's poor defense and mistakes led to their heavy defeat. The result surpassed Lyon's 10-2 demolition of Werder Bremen in 2005 as the largest winning margin in a post-group stage Champions League game.
A new study has found a possible link between exposure to Ground Zero debris and heart problems in police officers. The study, conducted by Dr. Lori Croft and funded by the Fraternal Order of Police of New York State, tested 1,200 police officers over 18 months. The results showed that 53% had abnormal left ventricular functioning and 59% had problems with their right ventricle, which is unusual for people in their 40s and 50s. This is the first study to suggest that exposure to Ground Zero debris may lead to cardiovascular problems, in addition to lung ailments already reported. The study's lead investigator, Dr. Croft, suggests that further research is needed to confirm the findings and put them in context.

Zinn cautioned that Obama could become a ""dangerous president"" if not pushed in a better direction by a national movement."
A Â£65 million research project at the University of Leeds aims to give people 50 active years after the age of 50. The goal is to enable people to stay healthy and active well into old age, with scientists planning to develop more durable implants and own-grown tissues to replace worn-out body parts. The project, driven by Professor John Fisher, focuses on repairing the body through biological scaffolds, stem cell therapy, and prosthetic joints that last longer. The research also aims to gain a better understanding of degenerative diseases, enabling early diagnosis and reducing suffering in patients.
A car bomb exploded outside a British army base in Northern Ireland's Belfast neighborhood, injuring one elderly male who was walking nearby. The bomb was placed in a stolen taxi, which was hijacked by three males before being driven to the Palace Barracks, the regional headquarters of Britain's MI5 intelligence service. The police and military staff evacuated the area before the explosion, which was likely intended to cause harm. The Real IRA, a republican splinter group, has reportedly admitted to being behind the attack. This incident is part of a recent surge in violence in Northern Ireland, blamed on dissident Irish republicans who reject the 1998 Good Friday accords and seek to drag the region back to the past.
"Actor Hugh Grant, comedian Steve Coogan, and former motor racing boss Max Mosley testified before British lawmakers about press ethics. They discussed the costs and consequences of dealing with paparazzi and newspapers. 

Mosley, who successfully sued the News of the World for libel, estimated that it costs around Â£1 million to get justice. Coogan stated that he spent Â£15,000-Â£20,000 to prevent a newspaper from publishing a story about a relative and over Â£200,000 due to phone hacking.

Mosley also highlighted the difference between defamation and invasion of privacy, sharing his experience of being wrongly accused of organizing a Nazi-themed orgy. The hearing is separate from the Leveson Inquiry, a government-backed investigation into press ethics, which was set up in response to phone hacking and police bribery scandals involving the News of the World."

"As President Obama marks his 100th day in office, a CNN poll of polls indicates that 63% of Americans approve of his performance, while 29% disapprove. This rating is down 3 percentage points from the previous poll, but still higher than many of his predecessors at the same stage. 

Compared to other presidents, Obama's approval rating is:

- Higher than Bill Clinton's 55% in 1993
- Lower than Ronald Reagan's 67% in 1981
- Similar to George W. Bush's 62% in 2001
- Similar to George H.W. Bush's 58% in 1989

CNN's polling director, Keating Holland, notes that Obama's approval rating may be higher due to Americans' perception of his personal qualities, which have improved since the campaign. However, Holland also warns that the ""danger period"" for presidents often comes later in their first year in office, and Obama's rating does not necessarily indicate he is ""out of the woods yet."""

A Turkish Airlines plane crashed on February 25 at Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport, killing nine people and injuring over 60 others. The Dutch Safety Board investigation found that a faulty altimeter, one of the plane's two altitude-measuring instruments, caused the plane to behave as if it was touching down while on automatic pilot. The altimeter indicated the plane was at ground level when it was actually 700 meters up. This led to a loss of speed, resulting in the crash. The pilots were aware of the problem but failed to appreciate its severity in time. The incident highlights the importance of manual intervention during automatic landings if there are instrument malfunctions.
Jenson Button, the 2010 Formula One world champion, set the fastest time during pre-season testing in Jerez, Spain.

"A new law proposed by French President Nicolas Sarkozy would allow shops in 20 designated zones to open on Sundays, breaking a century-old tradition of a day of rest. The law, which has been amended due to opposition from both the left and the right, would permit shops to open in ""exceptional commercial"" centers near Paris, Marseilles, and Lille, as well as in tourist areas. The measure aims to boost economic activity and simplify the current system, where some stores have obtained exceptions from the old law while others have been fined for breaking it. The law is expected to be approved by the Senate, despite opposition from leftists, unions, and some members of the president's own party."
"The International Cricket Council (ICC) has closed its investigation into match-fixing claims related to a one-day match between England and Pakistan in September. The ICC found a lack of ""compelling evidence"" to support the allegations, which claimed that bookmakers had prior knowledge of scoring patterns and that England players were paid to lose the match. The ICC has maintained its commitment to cleaning up the game and will continue to work with the Pakistan Cricket Board to implement reforms and restore confidence in the administration of cricket in Pakistan. The ICC also announced plans to introduce a world Test championship starting in 2013, featuring a playoff between the top four ranked Test teams every four years."
In southern Afghanistan, police have arrested Haji Sulaiman, the 45-year-old father-in-law of Bibi Aisha, who was subjected to a brutal honor killing. Aisha, 16 at the time, was accused of shaming her husband's family and was ordered by Sulaiman to have her nose and ears cut off by five others, including her husband. After the attack, Aisha passed out and was left for dead, but she survived and was later brought to the US for reconstructive surgery. Sulaiman was arrested two weeks ago and confessed to the crime, and his case has been submitted to the attorney general's office.
"In Pakistan, seven people were killed and 20 injured when Muslim protesters set fire to houses in a Christian enclave in the city of Gojra. The violence occurred after an alleged desecration of Quran pages at a Christian wedding. 

Security forces were deployed in the area, and the government condemned the incident, labeling it as terrorism. The government also announced that it would register a criminal case against those responsible for the attack. 

The attack is believed to be linked to militant groups in Northwest Pakistan. 

Separately, police in Islamabad arrested an al-Qaeda member suspected of involvement in several attacks, including the Danish Embassy and a hotel."
"According to exclusive information from a reliable source, the upcoming game ""Rock Band 3"" will feature a keytar-like instrument as the new addition, but not a keyboard peripheral as previously teased. The keytar will be created by Mad Catz, a company that will also produce all the game's instruments and bundles. 

In a shift from the previous strategy of releasing large bundles, Mad Catz will offer various bundles with different combinations of instruments, allowing retailers to stock only the game or a specific bundle. This change is likely due to the thin margins and high costs associated with large bundles.

Additionally, the game will include a ""pro"" mode that focuses on proper technique, potentially allowing players to develop actual guitar skills. The details of this mode are still unknown. The information is expected to be confirmed at E3."
Maria Sharapova defeated Caroline Wozniacki 7-5, 6-3 in the Rome Masters semifinals, avenging her loss to the Dane in the same stage of the Indian Wells event in March.

The police are now searching for any other potential victims who may have had contact with Huckaby.
China has stepped up criticism of Norway for awarding the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize to Liu Xiaobo, a Chinese dissident serving an 11-year prison term. Liu was sentenced for inciting subversion of state power after co-authoring Charter 08, a call for political reform and human rights. China's Foreign Ministry spokesman, Ma Zhaoxu, stated that the award will damage bilateral relations and disrespects China's judicial system. Liu Xia, his wife, remains under house arrest and is trying to visit her husband's lawyer to discuss an appeal. The Chinese government has also dismissed U.S. President Barack Obama's call for Liu's release, stating that it is an interference in China's internal affairs.
Former Taiwan President Chen Shui-bian has been convicted on corruption and money laundering charges. He was sentenced to life in prison and fined 200 million New Taiwan dollars ($6.1 million). His wife, Wu Shu-chen, was also convicted and received a life sentence with a 300 million New Taiwan dollars ($9.1 million) fine. The couple denied wrongdoing, claiming the charges are politically motivated. Prosecutors alleged that Chen embezzled 600 million New Taiwan dollars ($17.7 million) and took bribes. The case has been highly publicized, with supporters of Chen protesting outside the courthouse. This is the first corruption trial for a former Taiwanese head of state.
"Yemen's President Ali Abdullah Saleh plans to return to Yemen after an investigation into his attempted assassination is complete. The investigation, which has been ongoing for weeks, initially accused two opposition figures of planning the June palace bombing that left Saleh severely injured. However, the government has now switched gears, stating that the investigation is nearly complete but has not provided a timeline for its completion.

Saleh has been in Saudi Arabia for treatment and has been urged to accept a political transition plan that would lead to his departure. Some see the announcement as a tactic to delay stepping down, while others believe it is a way for Saleh to avoid facing possible criminal prosecution in Yemen.

The opposition hopes that Saleh's return will allow them to try him for the crimes he committed during his 33-year rule. Saleh had previously stated that he would leave office by the end of the year, but the opposition fears that if he leaves before then, it would be seen as him being ousted by the revolution rather than a voluntary departure."
"A motorcade carrying Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili and Polish President Lech Kaczynski came under fire near the breakaway region of South Ossetia in Georgia. According to the Georgian Interior Ministry, shots were fired from Russian-controlled territory, but the motorcade was not hit and there were no injuries. Russia and South Ossetia have denied the incident, calling it a ""provocation"" meant to destabilize the region. The incident occurred in a disputed area where tensions have remained high since fighting between Russian and Georgian troops broke out in August 2008."
"South Africa has denied the Dalai Lama a visa to attend a peace conference in Johannesburg, citing concerns that his presence would shift focus away from the 2010 World Cup. The Dalai Lama, a Nobel Laureate, was invited to the conference, which also featured other notable figures such as Archbishop Desmond Tutu and former President F.W. De Klerk. However, De Klerk and Tutu have announced they will boycott the event in protest of the visa denial, calling it a ""mockery"" of the peace conference and a violation of South Africa's principles of accountability and freedom of expression. The Tibetan government in exile believes China has pressured South Africa to deny the Dalai Lama a visa, a claim that South Africa has not confirmed."
"A series of storms brought torrential rainfall, flooding, and a rare tornado warning to California on Tuesday.

A rare tornado warning was issued for southeastern Orange County and northwestern San Diego County. Strong winds, including a 93 mph gust at the Newport Beach pier, were reported, and piers in Orange County were closed due to high surf.

Forecasters warned of potential landslides in recent burn areas and damaging winds. The storms caused power outages, and more severe weather is expected to hit the region on Wednesday and Thursday."
"A boat carrying approximately 200 Haitian migrants capsized off the coast of Turks and Caicos, a British territory southeast of Miami. The U.S. Coast Guard intercepted a similar overcrowded boat last week and returned its occupants to Haiti. 

As of Tuesday, 118 passengers have been rescued and 15 bodies have been found. The search for 67 missing people continues, with the Coast Guard contributing a boat and three aircraft, including a low-flying C-130 cargo plane. 

The boat is believed to have set sail from the Haitian port of Cap Haitien and was grossly overloaded, which can lead to capsizing and loss of life. The Coast Guard has also intercepted another overloaded boat in the same region, returning 124 Haitian migrants to Haiti."
"A report by the Pew Hispanic Center found that the number of unauthorized immigrants in the United States has declined for the first time in two decades. 

As of March 2009, there were 11.1 million unauthorized immigrants in the US, down from 12 million in March 2007. This represents an 8% decline. 

The decline was most significant in unauthorized immigrants from Latin American countries other than Mexico, with a 22% decrease. 

However, the Mexican unauthorized population has leveled off at around 7 million since 2007, making up 60% of all unauthorized immigrants. 

New arrivals of unauthorized immigrants have also decreased, with an average of 300,000 per year from 2005 to 2009, compared to 550,000 per year during the first half of the decade. 

Despite the decline, the unauthorized immigrant population remains nearly a third larger than in 2000 and three times larger than in 1990."
"China's Supreme People's Court has announced plans to reduce the number of executions carried out in the country. According to Vice President Zhang Jun, the court will tighten restrictions on the use of capital punishment, and legislation will be enacted to limit death sentences. The death penalty will now be reserved for serious offenders who commit crimes with ""grave social consequences."" This move is seen as a step in the right direction by China analysts, but they remain skeptical about its effectiveness. The number of executions in China is estimated to be between 1,700 and 5,000 per year, although the official number is a state secret."
Arctic reindeer herders in northern Scandinavia are benefiting from satellite maps provided by the European Space Agency's Polar View program. These maps show snow coverage and melt, helping herders determine the best foraging spots for their reindeer. Climate change is a significant concern, as rising temperatures may prevent ice layers from forming over pastures, restricting reindeer access. The International Center for Reindeer Husbandry is working with SÃ¡mi herders in Norway to develop sustainable reindeer husbandry practices using the satellite data, which could also help monitor land-use changes due to infrastructure development.
Oil from BP's ruptured well in Louisiana has washed ashore on barrier islands off Alabama and Mississippi. Researchers found rust-colored oil on Dauphin Island in Alabama and a 2-mile-long strip of oil on Petit Bois Island in Mississippi. The oil is believed to be from the undersea well and is expected to hit more coastal areas in the coming days. Despite the oil slick, vacationers remained on the beach and some were still swimming in the waters. Cleanup efforts are underway, with boats skimming oil off the surface of the water. The National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration had warned earlier that the oil slick was heading towards the Alabama and Mississippi coasts.
A long-running controversy surrounding Carlos Tevez's transfer to West Ham in 2006 has been settled out of court. West Ham and Sheffield United have reached a compensation agreement, with West Ham paying an undisclosed fee to settle the dispute. The issue began when West Ham signed Tevez under a third-party ownership deal that breached Premier League rules. Tevez's goal on the last day of the 2006-07 season helped West Ham avoid relegation, but Sheffield United was relegated instead. The dispute has led to three inquiries and a $8 million fine for West Ham. The out-of-court settlement will bring the controversy to an end, with West Ham paying the compensation fee in installments, potentially up to $35 million.

"The US federal government has released new guidelines for educators to address bullying and harassment in schools, emphasizing the importance of protecting students' federally protected civil rights. Failure to comply with these laws could result in a loss of federal funding. The guidelines were sent to thousands of schools, colleges, and universities, and the White House will host a conference next year to prevent bullying and harassment. The Obama administration has allocated $410 million for initiatives to support ""successful, safe, and healthy students."" While the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) welcomes the new guidelines, they call for a federal law to explicitly protect lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender students from harassment and discrimination."
The FBI quoted a senior agent saying that Mexico's drug cartels are more violent than al Qaeda, but the agency clarified that this is the opinion of one agent, not a collective FBI view. The report highlights the cartels' brutal tactics, including the use of acid to dissolve murder victims and severing heads. However, an analyst notes that comparing the two is complex, as al Qaeda has carried out large-scale attacks, such as hijacking planes and building complex bombs. While the cartels use terror in their rivalries, they have not reached the same level of sophistication as al Qaeda.

Pilots traveling in uniform on airline business can now bypass normal security screening by presenting their airline ID and another form of identification. This change aims to streamline the process and make more efficient use of resources. Pilots will still be subject to random screening and other security measures. The change is in response to pilot complaints that checking them for restricted objects is a waste of resources, given that many pilots are already licensed to carry firearms in cockpits. The TSA will phase in a more permanent system, starting immediately with the use of a secure, real-time airline crew member database.
"Lionel Messi led Barcelona to the Champions League semifinals with a stunning four-goal performance against Arsenal. His display took his goal tally for the season to 39, a staggering total that includes his fourth hat-trick of the season. Messi's incredible skills have drawn comparisons to a video game, with Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger calling him ""like a PlayStation."" However, Barcelona coach Pep Guardiola prefers to focus on Messi's humble character, which he believes is his greatest quality. Barcelona will face Inter Milan in the semifinals, with the two-leg tie set to be a highly anticipated matchup."

"Pakistan's President Asif Ali Zardari has defended his government's ceasefire deal with the Taliban in Swat Valley in a Wall Street Journal opinion piece. The deal, brokered by a pro-Taliban cleric, has been criticized as a major concession to the Taliban. However, Zardari claims that the deal was with moderate clerics who oppose the Taliban, not with the Taliban themselves. He also denies that the deal will lead to the closure of girls' schools in the region, stating that education for young women is mandatory and that the government will not condone extremism.

Under the deal, the Taliban has agreed to allow boys' schools to reopen and the government to set up temporary quarters for displaced residents. However, women in the area have expressed concerns that they will not be able to attend school and will be restricted under Taliban-imposed sharia law. The ceasefire deal has been met with international criticism, with many viewing it as a sign of weakness by the Pakistani government in the face of Taliban attacks."
"A disturbing incident occurred at a Wal-Mart Supercenter in Turnersville, New Jersey, where a male voice announced over the loudspeaker that ""all blacks need to leave the store."" The incident happened on a Sunday evening when the store was busy, causing shock and outrage among customers. The store's manager later apologized and contacted the police, who are investigating the incident as a suspected bias intimidation crime. Two customers, Victoria Arter and Patricia Covington, were particularly shaken by the experience and have vowed not to shop at the store again.

Deen, a member of the Plane Stupid group, opposes the expansion of Heathrow Airport and the planned third runway. She claimed that Mandelson's support for the expansion contradicts his stance on climate change. Mandelson, who escaped unharmed, stated that Deen failed to communicate her protest's purpose and dismissed it as an ""adolescent protest."" The incident follows another Plane Stupid protest at Aberdeen Airport earlier in the week, where nine protesters delayed flights to demonstrate against airport expansion."
Israel, founded in 1948, is a continuous democracy with a commitment to equality and universal suffrage. The 120-seat Knesset, the national parliament, is the seat of government, located in Jerusalem. Elections are held every four years, but the 2009 election was called early due to the resignation of Prime Minister Ehud Olmert. With 34 participating parties, including major ones like Kadima, Likud, and Labor, the task of forming a government falls to the party leader with the best chance of forming a viable coalition. The prime minister-designate has 42 days to build a coalition with at least 61 Knesset members' support.

The arrest was the result of a five-month intelligence operation and comes with a reward of up to $2.4 million."
The Taliban has taken control of Pakistan's Swat Valley and a neighboring district, Buner, after implementing Islamic law, or sharia, in the region. Swat Valley, once a popular tourist destination, has been plagued by violence and terrorized by the Taliban since 2008. The Pakistani government had previously launched a military offensive against the militants but later signed a peace deal allowing sharia law to be imposed. The deal, which was criticized by many, has led to the Taliban's expansion, with the group now closer to the capital, Islamabad, than ever before. Sharia law, as implemented by the Taliban, restricts women's rights, bans music and television, and imposes severe punishments for disobedience, including beheadings and lashings.
"A rare, unpublished letter written by President Theodore Roosevelt to his youngest son Quentin in 1903 is up for sale. The letter, valued at $25,000, is a display of affection between the two and provides a glimpse into life on a trip to Yellowstone National Park. In the letter, Roosevelt uses his son's nickname ""Quenty-Quee"" and includes a sketch of the mule that carried his gear. Quentin Roosevelt was known for his rambunctious behavior and later for his scholastic aptitude. He was killed in aerial combat during World War I at the age of 20, which deeply affected his father.

Researchers have discovered evidence of ancient cannabis use in the Gobi Desert, dating back 2,700 years. The find includes nearly two pounds of cannabis found in the tomb of a Gushi shaman, a Caucasian people who migrated from Russia to China. The cannabis is high in psychoactive properties and was likely used for medical or religious purposes, such as pain control or divination. The shaman's grave, which also contained equestrian equipment, archery gear, and a rare harp, suggests that the individual was of high status. Genetic analysis indicates that the cannabis was cultivated rather than gathered from the wild. This discovery is significant due to the high level of scientific investigation that has been conducted on the find, making it one of the best-studied examples of ancient cannabis use.

Estonia has ended its six-year military operation in Iraq by not replacing its platoon of 34 troops. The decision was made due to the absence of a legal agreement specifying the troops' status, an improving security situation in Iraq, and the Iraqi government's desire to continue cooperation in non-battle forms. Estonia will continue to participate in a NATO-led training mission in Iraq, but will formally terminate its defense forces' operation in the country. A bilateral agreement on future defense cooperation is still being negotiated.
"The Pentagon has reported that 61 former Guantanamo Bay detainees have returned to terrorism activities since 2002. This number has increased from 37 reported in 2008. Of these, 18 have been confirmed through intelligence and evidence, while 43 are suspected based on ""plausible reporting."" The confirmed cases include Adballah Salih al-Ajmi, a Kuwaiti man who blew himself up in a 2008 Iraq suicide attack.

He has already made a significant impact in the football world, finishing second in the FIFA World Player of the Year award twice. Born in 1987, Messi's talent was evident at a young age, and he has since won numerous titles with Barcelona, including the Champions League, and with the Argentine national team, including the Under-20 World Cup. He is expected to become the Champions League's leading scorer this season and is widely regarded as one of the greatest players in the world, with praise from his idol, Diego Maradona.
"A Russian naval ship intervened to rescue a Dutch container vessel from suspected Somali pirates in the Gulf of Aden. Two or three pirate speedboats were chasing the Dutch ship, firing rocket-propelled grenades, but no injuries were reported. The Russian ship chased one of the speedboats, but the pirates escaped. This incident highlights the growing concern of piracy in the region, with 115 reported pirate attacks off the Somali coast in 2008, including 46 successful hijackings.

The United Nations has taken steps to tackle the issue, forming a contact group to establish a counter-piracy coordination mechanism. The group aims to halt piracy, despite acknowledging that less than one percent of manifests are attacked, and only 50 percent of those have crew and passengers taken hostage. The U.N. Security Council has also adopted a resolution expanding counter-piracy measures, allowing national and regional military forces to chase pirates onshore in Somalia in ""hot pursuit."""

"Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson described their 4-3 victory over Manchester City as the ""best derby of all time."" Despite the thrilling win, Ferguson criticized his team's sloppy defense, which allowed City to equalize three times before Michael Owen's late winner in the 96th minute. 

City manager Mark Hughes expressed frustration over the referee's decision to add a significant amount of added time, which led to Owen's goal. Hughes felt his team was ""aggrieved"" and deserved a share of the spoils. 

Ferguson praised Owen for his clinical finish and described him as ""world class."" The victory moved United to second place in the Premier League, while City suffered their first defeat of the season."

Located at the Palace of Westminster, the clock tower houses a 14-ton bell that produces distinctive chimes known as bongs. The clock has survived various disruptions, including a two-month repair in 2007 and has been featured in several films. Its mechanism pays tribute to Britain's royal history, with a Latin inscription honoring Queen Victoria. The clock's unique features include a 300-kilogram hour hand made of gun metal and copper minute hands. The origin of Big Ben's name remains unclear, with theories suggesting it was named after a boxer or a former member of parliament, Sir Benjamin Hall.
Iraqi footballer Nashat Akram, who played in Iraq's Asian Cup-winning team, was denied a work permit to play for Premier League Manchester City due to a technicality in immigration rules. The rule requires his national side to be in the top 70 of the FIFA world rankings, which Iraq is not, as they are ranked 71. This decision is being appealed by Akram's supporters, including the Iraqi government and British politician Keith Vaz, who is calling on the Home Secretary to review the decision. Manchester City's boss, Sven-Goran Eriksson, expressed sympathy for Akram and plans to maintain an interest in him for the long term.

"The music industry is struggling to adapt to the digital era, with album sales declining and P2P file sharing prevalent. To counter this, major record labels Sony BMG, Universal Music Group, and Warner Music Group have partnered with MySpace Music. However, experts have differing opinions on the future of the industry. 

Bob Lefsetz believes the record labels will decline unless they adopt a new business model, as consumers prefer owning music to streaming it online. Moses Avalon is more optimistic about MySpace Music's prospects, while Andrew Dubber thinks the industry will undergo significant change with no set model for the future.

The article invites readers to share their views on the future of the music industry, asking if they think record labels can recover, if they have a business model that could work, or if the industry has no future at all."
Austin Taylor Bice, a 22-year-old San Diego State exchange student, was found dead in Madrid's Manzanares River in March. The final autopsy report indicates an accidental drowning death with no signs of external violence. Bice had been studying at the University of Carlos III in Madrid and was last seen outside a nightclub after a night out with friends. His body was recovered 10 days later, and the autopsy showed a high level of alcohol in his blood.

Qantas has grounded its A380 fleet and plans to resume flights within 48 hours after completing engine safety checks. The airline has six A380s in its fleet and hopes to resume operations without any adverse findings from the checks.
The Broadcast Committee of Advertising Practice in the UK has proposed new rules allowing British TV channels to advertise abortion services for the first time. These commercials would provide information on various options for pregnant women, including abortion, and would have to clearly state if an organization does not offer abortion information. Abortion clinics cannot directly advertise under these rules. The proposal also relaxes restrictions on condom advertising, allowing it to air on TV at any time except during children's programs. The public has until June 19 to comment on the proposals, which are expected to come into effect in 2010.

"Ivan Pictet, senior managing partner of Swiss bank Pictet & Cie, spoke with CNN about the evolution of Swiss banking. He stated that while Swiss banking still holds a strong position globally, it has changed due to new legislation on money laundering and confidentiality. Despite this, Pictet emphasized the bank's commitment to its core principles.

The bank has also expanded its investor base by allowing non-Swiss individuals to invest and become managing directors, a practice that began in 1991. This move has allowed the bank to retain top talent and incentivize new hires.

Pictet highlighted the bank's unique approach to risk management, where the seven partners bear personal responsibility for losses and their personal wealth is at stake daily. This approach has contributed to the bank's conservative and focused approach to asset management, avoiding diversification into other areas."
Pfizer, the world's leading drugmaker, is near a deal to buy rival Wyeth for $68 billion. The acquisition is likely to be announced on Monday, with Pfizer aiming to strengthen its drug pipeline. Wyeth's pipeline includes Alzheimer's treatments and a successful children's vaccine, Prevnar, which generated $2.1 billion in sales in the first nine months of 2008. Analysts believe Pfizer is trying to compensate for the loss of its cholesterol-cutting drug, Lipitor, which will lose patent protection in 2011. A merger with Wyeth could lead to layoffs among Wyeth staff, as Pfizer seeks to increase efficiency.
Casey Anthony, the mother of missing 3-year-old Caylee Anthony, was arrested and charged with forgery, fraudulent use of personal information, and petty theft.

"Thousands of people worldwide participated in May Day demonstrations on Saturday, demanding better working conditions and protesting against various issues. While many protests were peaceful, clashes occurred in several cities, including Athens, Greece, where police and protesters engaged in violent confrontations, resulting in injuries and arrests.

Clashes were also reported in several Asian cities, and protests against Arizona's new immigration law took place in the United States."
"Former 'American Idol' runner-up Diana DeGarmo expressed concerns that the show's concept of featuring amateur contestants is becoming harder to achieve. According to DeGarmo, each season's contract has become more restrictive, allowing contestants with professional experience to participate, but still excluding those who have released a record nationally. However, DeGarmo believes that the show's exposure and launching potential are now drawing more experienced contestants, including Adam Lambert, who has performed professionally in the national Broadway tour of ""Wicked"". Despite this, DeGarmo thinks Lambert's experience won't give him an unfair advantage in the competition."

She will move up to 10th in the rankings and has earned over $17 million in her career. Clijsters credited her hard work and support team, including her husband and fitness coach, for her success. Williams, who struggled with 29 unforced errors, attributed her loss to her own mistakes rather than Clijsters' exceptional play.
Two suspects were arrested over the weekend in Nairobi, Kenya, after authorities discovered two tons of raw elephant ivory and five rhinoceros horns disguised as avocados at the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport. The Kenya Wildlife Service, in collaboration with other stakeholders, conducted a joint operation to seize the contraband. The ivory is believed to have come from 150 elephants that died naturally over the past 20 years, but DNA tests will be conducted to confirm its origin. This seizure highlights the ongoing issue of wildlife poaching in Kenya, where 204 elephants and 13 rhinoceroses were killed illegally last year. The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species banned international commercial ivory trade in 1989, but the demand and price of ivory have continued to fluctuate, leading to ongoing poaching efforts.

Fidel Castro, the former President of Cuba, has criticized US President Obama for misinterpreting his brother RaÃºl's offer to start talks with the US. Fidel Castro stated that RaÃºl's declaration of willingness to discuss any topic, including human rights and political prisoners, was a sign of courage and confidence in the revolution, not a concession to the US. He suggested that Cuba would be willing to release prisoners held since a 2003 crackdown in exchange for the release of five Cubans convicted of spying in 2001. Fidel Castro also criticized Obama for not doing more to lift the US embargo on Cuba, imposed in 1962, and questioned who would be calling the shots in any talks with Washington. The situation raises uncertainty about the current leadership dynamics in Cuba.

After the trial, an alternate juror expressed difficulty in accepting that Caylee's body was in the car trunk.
A UK doctor, Bilal Abdulla, has been found guilty of conspiracy to murder and causing explosions. Abdulla, a Cambridge-educated graduate and NHS doctor, was part of a group that planned to plant car bombs in London. He and his co-conspirator, Kafeel Ahmed, were motivated by revenge for the bloodshed in Iraq. Abdulla's case is notable because he and Ahmed were well-educated professionals who were not previously on the radar of UK authorities. They were likely inspired by al-Qaeda in Iraq but developed their plan independently in the UK, using the internet for guidance. This case highlights a new type of terrorist who is self-motivated and unconventional, challenging traditional approaches to terrorism.

In a blog post, the White House stated that there is no evidence of alien contact, but acknowledged that the U.S. government is exploring the possibility of life existing outside Earth through various agencies, including NASA and the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI). The White House emphasized that while the odds of extraterrestrial life existing are high, the chances of making contact are extremely low due to the vast distances involved. This response satisfies the demands of two petitions, one of which gathered over 12,000 signatures.

Saudi Arabia's bid for a fourth Asian Cup title has ended with a 1-0 defeat to Jordan in the tournament. The loss came after a mistake from goalkeeper Waleed Abdullah, who misjudged a cross that looped into the net. Despite making four changes to his side, Saudi Arabia's new coach Nasser Al Johar was unable to secure a victory. Jordan's win puts them level with Japan at the top of the group, while Japan claimed a hard-fought 2-1 win over Syria in the day's other match. Japan's victory came despite being a man down after a contentious penalty decision, and they now need only a draw with Saudi Arabia in their final match to qualify for the next stage.

"The 2012 Aurora cinema massacre, which occurred during a screening of The Dark Knight Rises, bears eerie similarities to a 1986 Batman comic book strip, ""The Dark Knight Returns."" In the comic, a gunman named Arnold Crimp opens fire in a crowded theater after listening to Led Zeppelin's ""Stairway to Heaven,"" which he believes contains a hidden prayer to Satan. The comic's writer, Frank Miller, has not commented on the possible connection between the comic and the real-life massacre. The comic remains in print and was available for purchase on the day of the incident."
"Denmark has started paying compensation to women who have developed breast cancer after working night shifts. This move follows a 2007 World Health Organization (WHO) study that classified night work as ""probably carcinogenic to humans."" Studies have shown that long-term night workers, particularly nurses and flight attendants, have an increased risk of breast cancer due to disrupted circadian systems, altered sleep patterns, and suppressed melatonin production. Thirty-eight women have so far received compensation, and researchers are calling for further studies on the health implications of night work in various industries, including healthcare, hospitality, and manufacturing."
On Mexico's independence day, two explosions occurred in Morelia, the capital of Michoacan, killing 8 people and injuring 101, including 11 children. The blasts happened near the governor's residence and no suspects or group has claimed responsibility. Experts speculate that the attack could be linked to drug cartels or leftist guerrilla groups. This incident is part of a larger wave of violence in Mexico, with over 1,500 killings linked to organized crime this year. Mexican President Felipe Calderon condemned the attack and pledged to increase efforts to combat violent crime, with over 1,500 soldiers and federal police maintaining order on independence day.
"The South Carolina Ethics Commission has charged Governor Mark Sanford with 37 counts of violating state ethics laws. The charges include using taxpayer money for personal air travel, flying on a state-owned aircraft for non-official events, and using campaign funds for personal expenses. 

Sanford's office has not commented on the charges, but he will face a hearing before a three-member ethics panel. The hearing will determine if Sanford broke any state laws, and he can appeal decisions up to the state Supreme Court. 

The charges compound Sanford's existing political problems, including an impeachment resolution filed by state legislators for his unauthorized trip to visit his mistress in Argentina. The special House subcommittee will consider the impeachment resolution on Tuesday and may adjust it to include material from the ethics complaint. If the subcommittee decides to move forward with impeachment, it will require a two-thirds majority vote in both the House and Senate to remove Sanford from office."
"Royal Dutch Shell has declared ""force majeure"" in Nigeria after a rebel group, the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta (MEND), sabotaged two of its major pipelines. The attack has forced Shell to shut down some production and may not meet its oil supply obligations in the region. This disruption is expected to impact global oil prices, as Nigeria is the fourth-largest supplier of oil to the United States. MEND, which has been targeting foreign oil companies since 2006, hopes to secure a greater share of oil wealth for the people in the Niger Delta, where the majority of the population lives in poverty. The recent rebel attacks have already cut Nigeria's oil production by 10%, exacerbating the global oil shortage and contributing to higher gas prices in the US."

A $550,000 gold bar was stolen from the Mel Fisher Maritime Museum in Key West, Florida, on August 18. The thieves, described as modern-day pirates, entered the museum and used a video camera to their advantage. They broke a display case and removed the 16.5-karat gold bar, weighing 74.85 ounces, which was recovered from the shipwreck of the Santa Margarita in 1980. The FBI and Key West Police are working to solve the case, and a $25,000 reward has been offered. Experts believe the thieves made a mistake, as the market for high-profile items with distinguishing markings is small, and the item may be difficult to sell.
The mayor of Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, Jose Reyes Ferriz, is requesting that Mexican federal authorities delay the withdrawal of military units from the city for at least six more months. The troops were initially sent to the city in 2008 to combat violence involving warring drug cartels. Although the homicide rate decreased initially, it has spiked over the summer, with over 300 people killed in August. The mayor attributes the violence to wars between cartels over street drug-sale points, with most victims being youths between 14 and 25. Despite progress in strengthening the police force, the mayor believes the city is not ready for the army's full withdrawal. The military is evaluating the security situation and plans to implement a gradual withdrawal, with a decision expected before September 15.

The rally also highlighted the plight of American citizen children whose immigrant parents have been deported, leaving them alone and vulnerable.

A smaller anti-illegal immigration rally was held across the street, with some attendees expressing support for deporting immigrants who commit crimes. However, the majority of the May Day rally participants emphasized their contributions to the country and their desire for a path to citizenship."

A woman, Jill Haugen, was arrested in Pennsylvania after fleeing Washington state 11 years ago with her two sons, ages 15 and 16, against a court order. Haugen had contacted police saying she no longer wanted to care for her sons, leading to their placement in foster care. A felony warrant for first-degree custodial interference had been issued for her in 1998 after she failed to return the children to their father, Bill Connington, following their divorce. Haugen claimed to be a domestic abuse survivor and stated that her sons were also victims of sexual abuse, although the allegations against her ex-husband remain unsubstantiated.
Ruth Madoff, the wife of accused swindler Bernard Madoff, withdrew $15.5 million from a Madoff-related brokerage firm in Massachusetts in November and December 2008. This information was disclosed by state regulators in a complaint against Cohmad Securities, a firm allegedly intertwined with Madoff's company. Bernard Madoff is currently under house arrest in his Manhattan apartment, facing one charge of securities fraud and up to 20 years in prison. Prosecutors previously tried to revoke his $10 million bail after he mailed diamond-studded jewelry to friends and family. The deadline for an indictment or probable cause hearing has been pushed back another 30 days, and Madoff has agreed to a partial civil judgment, which could force him to pay fines and return investors' money.

Interior Minister Malik expressed his skepticism about the proposed ceasefire, stating that the Taliban have not kept their past commitments."
A wildfire on Angel Island, the largest in the San Francisco Bay, has consumed approximately 250 acres of vegetation. The fire began on Sunday evening and is still burning, with 200 firefighters involved in the effort. Marin County fire officials warn that it may take up to four days to contain the blaze.

Giant Nomura's jellyfish, measuring up to 6 feet in diameter and weighing over 450 pounds, have been invading the Sea of Japan for the third consecutive year. Originating from the Yellow Sea and Chinese waters, these massive creatures are transported by ocean currents and often get caught in fishermen's nets, causing significant damage and economic losses to coastal villages in Japan. The jellyfish's enormous size and destructive habits have prompted the Japanese government to implement a warning system for fishermen, allowing them to save their expensive nets from destruction. However, the reason behind the recurring invasions remains unclear, with possible factors including overfishing, pollution, and rising ocean temperatures.
"A severe food shortage in Zimbabwe is causing a humanitarian crisis, with 5 million people in need of food aid. According to Save the Children, the number of acute child malnutrition cases has risen by almost two-thirds in the past year. The organization is appealing for 18,000 tons of food to prevent a complete collapse of the food aid pipeline.

The country's economic and humanitarian crisis is attributed to President Robert Mugabe's economic policies and a decade-long economic downturn. A cholera epidemic has claimed over 1,100 lives and infected over 20,000 people, while inflation is so severe that the government has had to print $10 billion currency notes.

The crisis has been exacerbated by a political dispute between Mugabe's government and the opposition party, which has prevented the formation of a unity government agreed upon in September. The situation has left millions of Zimbabweans, including children, vulnerable to starvation and disease."

Toyota's CEO Akio Toyoda is facing a challenge as he testifies before US legislators, partly due to cultural differences between Japan and the West. The company's slow decision-making process, typical in Japanese culture, has been criticized as inadequate for the fast-paced international media environment. Toyoda is accustomed to a deferential Japanese press, whereas in the US, he will face hostile questioning. Cultural differences in body language and language style may also impact how his performance is perceived, with humility in Japan potentially being misinterpreted as weakness in the West.
The International Gymnastics Federation has concluded that China's women's gymnastics team did not use underage competitors during the Beijing Olympics. The federation investigated claims that gold medal winner He Kexin was only 14 years old, but confirmed her age through official documents provided by the Chinese Gymnasts Association. However, the federation will further investigate the ages of two other gymnasts, Dong Fangxiao and Yang Yun, who participated in the 2000 Sydney Olympics, as they did not find their explanations and evidence satisfactory. The investigation was sparked by bloggers and media outlets who questioned the ages of several Chinese gymnasts, citing discrepancies in their birthdates and ages.
"Iran has condemned the kidnapping of one of its diplomats, Heshmatollah Attarzadeh, in Peshawar, Pakistan, calling it an ""act of terrorism."" Attarzadeh, a commercial attache, was abducted by at least four gunmen near his home while heading to work at the Iranian consulate. His Pakistani bodyguard was killed during the incident.

He left the Catholic Church and joined the Episcopal Church, where he was received on May 28. Cutie will pursue the priesthood in the Episcopal faith, but the process is unclear. The Catholic Church's archbishop, John C. Favalora, criticized Cutie's actions and the Episcopal Church's decision to accept him, calling it a ""serious setback"" for ecumenical relations."
The US military has surpassed 1,000 troop deaths in Afghanistan, with 1,001 casualties now reported. This milestone comes as the war in Afghanistan is becoming increasingly deadly, with the highest annual casualty rate recorded in 2009. The death toll is expected to continue rising, with 2010 potentially being the deadliest year of the conflict.

"China has refused entry to nine U.S. Navy ships and one U.S. Air Force jet into Hong Kong over the past month, citing no official reason. The U.S. military officials are baffled by the refusals, which occurred around the time of the Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays. 

The denied vessels include the USS Reuben James, USS Kitty Hawk aircraft carrier battle group, and a U.S. Air Force C-17 flight, which was scheduled for a routine resupply of the U.S. Consulate in Hong Kong. 

The United States has filed a formal protest with China, and the White House is seeking a clarification on the matter. 

This development comes amid tensions between the U.S. and China over U.S. arms sales to Taiwan and President Bush's presentation of a Congressional Gold Medal to the Dalai Lama.

Additionally, Japan has tightened its approval process for Chinese navy visits to its ports, with crew members from a Chinese ship making a port call in Japan potentially being denied the opportunity to tour a Japanese Aegis warship."
German billionaire Susanne Klatten, the daughter of BMW's late chief Herbert Quandt, has been the victim of blackmail and fraud. A former lover, identified as Helg Scarbi, threatened to release compromising pictures of them together unless Klatten paid him millions of euros. Klatten alerted police in January, and an investigation led to Scarbi's arrest in January. It's alleged that Scarbi demanded â‚¬40 million from Klatten, who holds a 12.5% stake in BMW and a 51.1% share of chemical company Altana. Klatten's actions were seen as courageous, despite the potential public repercussions.

"A US federal appeals court has upheld a $413 million judgment against Syria, resulting from the 2004 murder of two American military contractors, Olin ""Jack"" Armstrong and Jack Hensley, by al-Qaeda in Iraq. The court ruled that Syria provided ""material support"" to the terrorist group, which led to the gruesome beheadings. The families of the victims claimed Syrian officials facilitated the torture and beheadings, and the court agreed that it had jurisdiction to hear the case. The decision is a victory for the families and a legal blow to Syria, which has been on the US list of ""state sponsors of terrorism"" since 1979."
An archaeological team has completed a ground-penetrating radar survey of the Egyptian temple of Taposiris Magna, where Cleopatra and Mark Antony may be buried. The survey revealed three possible spots of interest, and recent excavations have uncovered a large, previously unknown cemetery outside the temple, suggesting an important person of royal status could be buried inside. The team has discovered 27 tombs, 10 mummies, and an alabaster bust of Cleopatra, along with coins bearing her image. A unique mask found bears a resemblance to known portraits of Mark Antony. These discoveries support the idea that the temple could be the final resting place of the doomed lovers.
"Six-year-old Max Page, a young boy with a congenital heart defect, gained widespread attention after appearing in a Volkswagen Super Bowl advertisement dressed as Darth Vader. The commercial, viewed by over 110 million Americans and 20 million on YouTube, depicts Max trying to use ""The Force"" to control various objects, but ultimately succeeding in starting his dad's car. Max's authenticity in portraying Darth Vader, rather than mimicking him, was praised by the director. Despite being compared to young actors from the Star Wars franchise, Max has not seen the movies and is still a bit scared of the character. His story has inspired others, and he leads a normal life despite his heart condition."

European leaders agreed to send a 1,800-strong security force to Kosovo to maintain stability ahead of the province's expected declaration of independence from Serbia in early 2024. The move is seen as a signal that the EU will lead on the issue of Kosovo's future, but EU leaders stopped short of backing independence. Serbia, seeking EU membership, insists Kosovo should remain autonomous within its borders. The EU mission will help ease the transition from the UN to local authorities, and Serbia's EU membership is dependent on it recognizing Kosovo's independence and handing over war criminals.
"US President George Bush has criticized the government of Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe for its handling of the upcoming presidential runoff election. Opposition leader Artur Mutambara was arrested for criticizing the government and its recent presidential election.

However, efforts to support these women have increased, with organizations providing assistance and a new law adopted in 2004 giving women more rights. Despite progress, men still largely reject unmarried mothers and their children, with some viewing them as prostitutes.

This extension was made just hours before their certification was set to expire on New Year's Eve, amidst concerns about air security following the attempted bombing of Northwest Flight 253 on Christmas Day. FFDOs are commercial pilots who volunteer to undergo training to carry firearms and protect their aircraft. The extension was made due to ""recent events"" and will allow the pilots to continue carrying weapons, but the program's limited budget remains a concern, as it has not increased since 2003, effectively capping the number of armed pilots."

The trial of Mohammed Ajmal Kasab, the main suspect in the 2008 Mumbai terrorist attack, has been delayed due to a conflict of interest issue involving his lawyer, Anjali Waghmare. The judge removed Waghmare after discovering she was also representing a witness in the case. Kasab, a Pakistani national, faces over a dozen charges, including murder and terrorism. He requested a Pakistani lawyer, which was denied, but may be allowed as a consultant from outside the courtroom. The trial, initially set to begin on Wednesday, has been rescheduled for Thursday.
"The US Supreme Court has agreed to hear a case involving the prosecution of an illegal immigrant, Ignacio Flores-Figueroa, who was convicted of ""aggravated identity theft"" for using fake Social Security and alien registration cards to obtain work in the US. The issue is whether a person can be convicted of this crime if they did not know the documents belonged to someone else. The Justice Department argues that prosecutors do not need to prove knowledge, while Flores-Figueroa's lawyers claim that their client only used fabricated numbers to obtain work and did not intend to steal money. The court's decision is expected by June and could impact the government's crackdown on undocumented workers who often rely on fake IDs to obtain employment."

"Julie Ann Gonzalez, a 21-year-old Texas woman, has been missing since March 26. Her estranged husband, George De La Cruz, is considered a ""person of interest"" by Austin police. However, De La Cruz's lawyer claims he has a ""completely watertight alibi"" for the day of Gonzalez's disappearance. According to De La Cruz, Gonzalez appeared ""out of it"" when she came to pick up their daughter and changed her mind about taking her. Gonzalez was going through a divorce and had mentioned a new man in her life. Her car was found abandoned, and her bank account has not been accessed since her disappearance. Despite this, De La Cruz's lawyer says he purchased a movie using Gonzalez's credit card, which he claims was done with her permission. He spent three hours with detectives, providing explanations for the evidence against him, and believes that when all facts are revealed, his innocence will be clear."
Farmers in Argentina blocked highways and rural routes to protest the government's lack of progress in negotiations over export taxes on farm goods. The protests, which have been ongoing for a year, are centered around a 35% tax on soybean exports, with the country being the world's third-largest soybean exporter. President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner announced a new fund that would share soybean revenues with provinces and municipalities, but farm leaders criticized the move as a political gesture during an election year. The protests have caused food shortages and blocked farm products from leaving the country in the past, and farmers are demanding a reduction in the export tax.
The International Gymnastics Federation has concluded that the Chinese women's gymnastics team did not use underage competitors during the 2008 Beijing Olympics. The federation confirmed the ages of the gymnasts through official documents provided by the Chinese Gymnasts Association. However, they will further investigate the ages of two gymnasts, Dong Fangxiao and Yang Yun, who competed in the 2000 Sydney Olympics. The investigation was sparked by claims from bloggers and media outlets that several Chinese gymnasts, including gold medal winner He Kexin, were underage. Despite the federation's conclusion, concerns remain due to the advantage younger gymnasts have over older competitors.
"Zsa Zsa Gabor, a 94-year-old actress, is receiving treatment at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center for a severe infection in her lower leg. Doctors have taken a ""last shot"" at saving her leg with powerful antibiotics, but if this treatment fails, amputation below the knee may be necessary. Gabor's husband, Prince Frederic Von Anhalt, has not informed her of the potential amputation, as he fears it would cause her a heart attack. Her condition worsened in recent days due to gangrene, and she has been frail and wheelchair-bound since a 2002 car accident."
"Japanese stocks plummeted 10.55% on the day, with the Nikkei experiencing its third-largest percentage drop in history. The market recovered from a deeper loss earlier in the session, but the close at 8,605.15 marked a nearly 17% drop in two days. The decline was triggered by concerns over the nuclear crisis at the Fukushima Daiichi plant, which reported an ""explosive impact"" at its No. 2 reactor. The death toll from the 9.0-magnitude earthquake and tsunami has risen to 2,475, with over 450,000 people reported homeless. The crisis has also affected global markets, with other Asian markets down and US markets set for a lower open."
Tyson Gay won the 200m event at the London Grand Prix, finishing in 20 seconds dead. Despite a minor groin injury, Gay easily took the lead and left compatriot Wallace Spearman 20 meters behind.

In a World Cup Group D match, Australia drew 1-1 with Ghana despite playing with 10 men for over an hour. Ghana's Asamoah Gyan scored the equalizing penalty in the 24th minute after Australia's Harry Kewell was given a straight red card for blocking a shot with his arm. Australia's Brett Holman had given them the lead in the 11th minute, capitalizing on a mistake by Ghana's goalkeeper. The result puts Ghana in a strong position to qualify for the second round, while Australia's chances are slim. Australia's coach Pim Verbeek acknowledged the difficulty of their situation but refused to give up hope.
A lesbian couple, Sinjoyla Townsend and Angelisa Young, became the first same-sex couple to marry in Washington D.C. on July 26, 2010. The couple, who have been together for 12 years and have children, applied for a marriage license last week and were among 100 couples. The marriage is allowed under the new law that went into effect after the Supreme Court rejected a request to block it. The law, which was signed by Mayor Adrian Fenty in December, makes Washington D.C. the sixth jurisdiction in the US to allow same-sex couples to marry, following Connecticut, Iowa, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Vermont.
The captain and chief officer of a Chinese-registered ship, Shen Neng 1, will appear in an Australian court on charges of damaging the Great Barrier Reef. On April 3, the ship ran aground 27 kilometers off course while carrying 65,000 tons of coal. A small oil slick was contained by crews, but not before raising concerns of an oil spill near the world's largest coral reef system. The captain faces a maximum fine of $50,852, while the chief officer faces up to three years in prison and a fine of $203,411.
A 31-year-old Ecuadorean man, Jose Sucuzhanay, has died from severe head trauma sustained in a beating that occurred on December 7 in Brooklyn, New York. The incident, which may be a hate crime, involved anti-LGBT and anti-Latino slurs being shouted at Sucuzhanay and his 38-year-old brother, Romel, after they left a party at a Catholic church. Police have not categorized the attack as a hate crime, but City Council Speaker Christine Quinn has expressed outrage and is working with the NYPD's Hate Crimes Task Force. No arrests have been made, and a $22,000 reward is being offered for information leading to the arrest and conviction of those involved.
A new report by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) states that the world has lost almost 20% of its coral reefs over the past 20 years. If left unchecked, coral reefs could be completely wiped out by 2050 due to climate change, overfishing, pollution, and invasive species. Climate change is the biggest threat, with the 1998 El Nino being the most destructive event to impact coral reefs. However, 45% of the world's reefs are currently in good health, and researchers believe that damaged reefs can recover if helped to adapt to climate change and if destructive practices are stopped. The loss of coral reefs would have severe consequences for the 500 million people who rely on them for their livelihood.
A recent United Nations study found that Afghanistan's opium production has decreased by 10% and cultivation by 22% this year. The decline is attributed to improved government leadership, aggressive counter-narcotics tactics, and efforts to encourage farmers to grow legal crops. The most significant drop was seen in Helmand province, where cultivation decreased by 32%. However, some experts fear that drug traffickers may be preparing to fight back, as evidence of strong drug cartels similar to those in Colombia has been found. Incentive programs providing farmers with seeds and training to grow legal crops are seen as a key tactic in the fight against drugs, with some farmers expressing optimism that these programs can help bring peace to war-torn Afghanistan.
A Kenyan delegation has agreed with the International Criminal Court to establish a tribunal by July 2010 to prosecute those responsible for the 2007 post-election violence that killed nearly 1,500 people and displaced hundreds of thousands. If the tribunal is not formed, the case will be referred to the court's prosecutor. The agreement also includes a report on the current status of investigations and prosecutions. This comes after a disputed election in December 2007, where opposition leader Raila Odinga claimed the vote was rigged, leading to widespread violence. The agreement gives the Kenyan government breathing room, but analysts warn that without key reforms, the next general election in 2012 may descend into violence.

"Seth Meyers, the head writer and host of the ""Saturday Night Live"" (SNL) ""Weekend Update"" segment, has confirmed that he will continue to host the show solo, at least for the near future. This decision comes after rumors that Kristen Wiig would join him as a co-anchor. However, Meyers stated that Wiig is ""almost too valuable"" to be limited to a full-time co-anchor role, as it would prevent her from playing guest characters.

Amy Poehler, who left the show last season, will still appear in some segments of ""Weekend Update Thursday,"" a prime-time version of the skit. The show's 35th season premiere is scheduled for September 26, hosted by Megan Fox with musical guest U2.

The crisis began when the government sacked the army chief, Gen. Rookmangud Katawal, but the president reinstated him hours later. Prachanda cited concerns over Nepal's ""infant democracy"" and the peace process, which was established after a decade-long Maoist insurgency. The dispute was sparked by the government's decision to recruit new soldiers without integrating former Maoist rebels into the security forces, as required by a 2006 peace deal. Prachanda blamed certain parties and ""power centers"" for undermining the democracy and constitution, and appealed to the people to support the struggle for a democratic Nepal."

"In 2010, Vice's VBS.TV team covered the violent student demonstrations in London, where they observed a unique and chaotic scene. The team was ""kettled"" with thousands of protesters for 10 hours, witnessing vandalism, police brutality, and even gang-related violence. They discovered that some gangs had infiltrated the protests to commit crimes, including pickpocketing, mugging, and looting. A gang in South East London revealed that they had made over Â£2,000 from the previous protest. The Vice team predicted that as government cuts spread, more riots would occur in impoverished areas, led by armed gang members, rather than students. This experience led to a five-part documentary, ""Teenage Riot,"" which explores the significance of the 2010 London riots."
A massive iceberg, measuring 140 square kilometers, is drifting towards Australia. It was named B17B and is estimated to be over twice the size of Manhattan island. The iceberg, which broke off from an Antarctic ice shelf nearly 10 years ago, is currently 1,700 kilometers off the coast of West Australia. Scientists expect it to melt due to warmer waters, resulting in smaller icebergs. This is not the only iceberg sighting; in November, a large iceberg was spotted near Macquarie Island in the southern Pacific, prompting navigation warnings for shipping lanes. Researchers attribute the icebergs to a larger ice flow possibly originating from the Ross Ice Shelf in Antarctica. While some scientists link the movement to global warming, others suggest it may be a natural occurrence occurring on a 30-50 year period.

"Recent satellite images show the devastating impact of floods in Thailand, with over 200,000 hectares of farmland and 1,000 factories affected. The floods, which have caused estimated economic losses of over $3 billion, have also forced the closure of the Don Muang Airport on the outskirts of Bangkok. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) attributes the severity of the floods to urbanization, which has led to the destruction of natural floodplains and the loss of plants that soak up excess water. This is seen as a ""wake-up call"" for unplanned growth, with experts highlighting the importance of preserving natural floodplains to mitigate the impact of flooding."
Tuvalu, a small Pacific nation, aims to be powered entirely by renewable energy sources by 2020.

The fossils indicate that the head and neck evolved first, followed by the body, tail, wings, and legs. The discovery has astounded scientists, with more study needed to confirm the idea that whole parts of a body can change quickly. The research, published in the ""Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences,"" provides the first clear evidence of a controversial theory of evolution."

In an effort to combat the opium trade in Afghanistan, the US Agency for International Development (USAID) is sponsoring programs to encourage farmers to switch from poppy crops to wheat. These programs, which provide seeds, fertilizers, and improved irrigation, have led to a significant decline in opium cultivation, with 20% fewer poppy-free provinces in 2008 compared to the previous year. USAID has distributed over $22 million to nearly 210,000 Afghans to build roads and irrigation canals, giving farmers improved access to markets and successfully reducing poppy production. This shift is expected to weaken the insurgency, as opium and heroin have been a major source of revenue for groups like the Taliban.
"Thousands of people in Sudan's Darfur region have fled to the Zam Zam refugee camp due to ongoing fighting between Sudanese government forces and the rebel Justice and Equality Movement (JEM). Over 15,000 people have arrived at the camp, straining the water supply. The conflict, which began in 2003, has resulted in an estimated 300,000 deaths and 2.7 million displaced people. A ""goodwill and confidence-building"" agreement was signed in February, but fighting continues. The UN-African Union peacekeeping mission (UNAMID) plans to build a community police center near the camp. The Sudanese government's campaign of violence in Darfur has been described as genocide by the International Criminal Court, which charged President Omar al-Bashir in 2022."
"Ali Hassan al-Majeed, also known as ""Chemical Ali,"" was executed by hanging in Iraq on Monday. He was a cousin of Saddam Hussein and had been convicted of 13 counts of killings and genocide, including a 1988 poison gas attack on the Kurdish village of Halabja that killed approximately 5,000 people. Al-Majeed had been held in US custody since 2003 but was handed over to Iraqi authorities before his execution. He was sentenced to death in four separate trials for his roles in various massacres, including the 1991 Shiite uprising and the 1999 Baghdad revolt."
"A new national poll by CNN/Opinion Research Corp. has found that African-Americans' enthusiasm for President Obama has significantly dropped from earlier this year. Although 90% of black respondents approve of Obama's performance, only 42% say they are ""thrilled"" about his presidency, down from 61% in January. 

The poll also indicates that:

- 51% of African-Americans believe Obama's presidency has improved race relations, but only 18% think it marks a new era.
- 75% of blacks expect race relations to improve eventually, up from 49% before Obama's election.
- Whites are less supportive of Obama, with 15% believing he has made race relations worse.
- A notable number of whites disapprove of Obama due to his perceived lack of liberalism.

The poll was conducted from December 16-20, with a sampling error of 3% for the overall population and 6% for the African-American sample."
A boat carrying 250 African migrants capsized off the coast of Libya, with at least 20 confirmed dead and 23 rescued. The migrants were heading to southern Europe, likely the Italian island of Lampedusa. Another boat with around 350 migrants was rescued and taken to a center in Tripoli, Libya. The rescued migrants came from various countries, including Egypt, Somalia, Ghana, Nigeria, and Asia. The incident occurred at the beginning of the Mediterranean smuggling season and highlights the dangers faced by migrants and refugees trying to escape poverty and persecution.
A 28-year-old woman, Bethany Storro, was released from the hospital after an acid attack in Portland, Oregon. The incident occurred last Monday when an unknown woman threw a cup of caustic liquid in her face at a Starbucks. Storro credits her new sunglasses, purchased just before the attack, with saving her eyesight. A composite sketch of the suspect has been released, described as an African-American woman with an athletic build and slicked-back hair. Storro is cooperating with the investigation and hopes her story will help identify the assailant before she can harm someone else.
Haiti's former President Jean-Bertrand Aristide has been issued a new passport, allowing him to potentially return home after seven years in exile in South Africa. The diplomatic passport was handed over to his U.S. attorney, Ira Kurzban. However, Aristide's return is still conditional on cooperation from South Africa and the United States. The U.S. State Department has expressed concerns that Aristide's return could be divisive and distract from Haiti's efforts to form a new government. Despite this, supporters of Aristide, including his party's coordinator, predict a large welcome for the former president, who has been a polarizing figure in Haiti since leaving in 2004. His return comes at a critical time for Haiti, which is recovering from a devastating earthquake and a cholera epidemic, and is preparing for a presidential runoff in March.
A 15-year-old boy, Michael Brewer, who was severely burned over 65% of his body in October, has been readmitted to a Miami hospital due to breathing complications. Brewer had been released from the hospital's burn unit two months prior after undergoing three skin graft surgeries and spending almost a month on a ventilator. Three teenagers, aged 15 and 16, have been charged with attempted murder in connection with the incident, allegedly motivated by a $40 debt Brewer owed one of the suspects. The three face up to 30 years in prison if convicted.
"The Jenolan Caves National Park in Australia is now offering a self-guided audio tour in the Klingon language, making it the first tourist attraction to do so. The tour, available in the ""Nettle Cave,"" is part of the oldest cave system in the world and attracts 150,000 to 200,000 visitors annually. The decision to add Klingon was inspired by the park's connection to the Star Trek franchise, as a transport vessel in the 1992 episode ""Relics"" was named after the caves. Two Klingon scholars translated the English audio tour into Klingon, making it available to the estimated 2,500 members of the Klingon Language Institute in 50 countries."
In Sri Lanka, a second bomb blast occurred in Colombo, 24 hours after a previous attack, leaving two people wounded and a store damaged. The attacks follow the fall of the Tamil Tigers' capital, Kilinochchi, to government troops. President Mahinda Rajapaksa called for the Tigers to lay down their arms and end the quarter-century civil war after his troops retook Kilinochchi. The U.S. has designated the Tamil Tigers as a terrorist organization, and the civil war has resulted in over 65,000 deaths.
Queen Elizabeth II delivered her Christmas Day message, reflecting on the global economic and political crises affecting holiday festivities. She acknowledged the impact of these crises on people's lives, causing feelings of insecurity and uncertainty. The Queen encouraged Britons to find happiness and courage by helping others, citing examples of World War I veterans and current troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. She noted that people who live unselfish and outgoing lives, using their talents and resources for the benefit of others, seem to be the most contented and fulfilled.

She concluded by referencing Jesus Christ, who lived an unselfish and sacrificial life, and emphasized the importance of giving and serving others for genuine human happiness and satisfaction.
"A federal judge in Mexico ordered the arrest of 10 municipal police officers in connection with the killings of 12 off-duty federal agents in Michoacan state. The violence was sparked by the arrest of high-ranking drug cartel member Arnoldo Rueda Medina. 

Since July 11, at least 20 federal agents and 2 soldiers have been killed in the area due to drug-related violence. The cartel, La Familia Michoacana, is suspected to be behind the attacks.

In response to the violence, Mexican President Felipe Calderon deployed 1,000 federal police officers to the area, which Michoacan Gov. Leonel Godoy Rangel called an ""occupation."" Authorities are searching for the governor's half-brother, Julio Cesar Godoy Toscano, who is a top-ranking member of the cartel.

The officers arrested will be held for 40 days while officials determine whether to formally charge them."
"Researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) have developed a new generation of robotic fish, also known as ""robofish."" These sleek, streamlined fish are capable of mimicking the movements of real fish and can explore underwater terrain that submersibles cannot. The robofish are designed for tasks such as mapping the ocean floor, detecting pollution, and inspecting submerged boats or oil and gas pipelines. They are also cheap to produce, with a cost of only a few hundred dollars and only 10 parts, compared to the thousands used in the first robotic fish developed in 1994. The new robofish have withstood harsh conditions in the lab and have sparked interest from companies such as Schlumberger and the U.S. Navy. The researchers are now working on new robotic projects, including a robotic manta ray and a terrestrial robot in the form of a salamander."
"In a nationwide crackdown, US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has arrested over 1,300 suspected gang members, including 343 with violent histories, in the past three months. The operation, part of the ""Operation Community Shield"" initiative, targeted gangs such as MS-13, which is believed to be the fastest-growing and most violent gang in the US. The majority of arrests were made in New York and Miami, but gang members were also apprehended in smaller cities across the country. Of those arrested, 374 face criminal charges, while the rest will face deportation. The operation has resulted in the arrest of over 7,000 alleged gang members and their associates since its inception in 2005."
"Zimbabwe's First Lady, Grace Mugabe, has sued a local newspaper, The Standard, for $15 million over a report alleging she profited from illegal diamond sales. The report, based on leaked US diplomatic cables, claimed she and other government officials gained huge profits from diamond smuggling, contributing to Zimbabwe's hyperinflation crisis. Mugabe denies the allegations, calling them ""false, scandalous, and malicious."" The Zimbabwe Union of Journalists has condemned the lawsuit, stating it's an attempt to silence the press and restrict access to information. The newspaper's attorney plans to respond to the summons, calling the lawsuit an attempt to harass the press."
South Africa's World Cup hopes are in jeopardy after a 3-0 loss to Uruguay in Group A. Diego Forlan scored the first goal in the first half after a deflection off Aaron Mokoena. In the second half, Uruguay's Luis Suarez was brought down in the penalty area by goalkeeper Itumeleng Khune, who was sent off. Forlan converted the resulting penalty, and Uruguay's Alvaro Pereira added a third goal late in the game. Uruguay now leads Group A with four points, while South Africa has only one point. South Africa must beat France in their final game to have any chance of advancing to the knockout stages.
"Richard Heene and his wife Mayumi pleaded guilty to charges related to the ""balloon boy"" case. In October 2009, the couple claimed their 6-year-old son Falcon was inside a loose helium balloon, prompting a nationwide search. However, it was later revealed that the incident was a hoax, and Falcon was safe at home. The couple agreed to a plea deal, with Richard facing up to 90 days in jail and Mayumi up to 60 days. Their lawyers stated that the threat of Mayumi's deportation, as a Japanese citizen, was a factor in the plea negotiations. Sentencing is set for next month, and the couple is allowed to leave the state while on bond."
"American radio talk-show host Michael Savage, also known as Michael Alan Weiner, has been banned from entering the United Kingdom due to the British government's concerns that he ""stirs up hatred."" Savage claims he is being unfairly targeted and wants an apology from Home Secretary Jacqui Smith and his name removed from the list. He believes his patriotic and conservative views, expressed on his radio show ""The Savage Nation,"" are being misconstrued as promoting violence. Savage rejects the British government's description of him as ""demented"" and says he has never promoted violence on his show. He is now considering legal action against the British government."
The presidents of Sudan and Chad, Omar al-Beshir and Idriss Deby, have signed a non-aggression agreement to halt cross-border hostilities. The deal was reached after two days of talks in Dakar, Senegal, facilitated by Senegalese President Abdoulaye Wade and witnessed by United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon. The agreement aims to normalize relations between the two countries and prevent the cross-border movement of rebel groups. The countries have a history of accusing each other of supporting armed rebel groups, and their armies have skirmished several times. The United Nations will work to ensure the countries carry out the terms of the deal, which comes as the region is experiencing a growing number of refugees and displaced people due to the conflict in Darfur.
A court in California has ordered pop singer Britney Spears to give up custody of her two sons, Sean Preston and Jayden, to her ex-husband Kevin Federline. The decision, made by Superior Court Judge Scott Gordon, was issued without explanation, and a transcript of the court proceedings was sealed. This ruling comes after a previous order requiring Spears to undergo random drug tests and counseling due to concerns about her substance use. Spears and Federline had previously shared 50-50 custody, but Federline had requested a 70-30 split in his favor.
A magnitude-6.4 earthquake struck Japan on Tuesday morning, killing at least six people when a landslide buried three homes in Iwaki. Three people were rescued and hospitalized, and rescue efforts are ongoing for an unknown number of others trapped. The earthquake occurred one month after a devastating 9.0-magnitude quake and tsunami. Although the latest quake did not cause a tsunami, it triggered landslides and power outages, affecting 220,000 households and businesses in Fukushima. The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant, which has been struggling with cooling problems and radiation leaks, briefly evacuated workers but resumed efforts to cool the facility. Japan is dealing with hundreds of aftershocks and ongoing rescue efforts following the March 11 earthquake and tsunami that killed over 13,000 people and left 14,000 missing.

"US Representative Anthony Weiner admitted to lying about posting explicit photos on his Twitter account and having online relationships with women. Despite a phone conversation with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, Weiner refused to resign. Pelosi called for an investigation by the House Ethics Commission to determine if Weiner used congressional resources for his illicit activities. Weiner claims his BlackBerry is not government-funded and he did not use government resources. Other Democrats, including Rep. Steve Israel, have backed Pelosi's call for an investigation, while a Republican source considers it ""hollow"" due to Pelosi not demanding Weiner's resignation."

"New York City and Washington D.C. will implement a new emergency alert system called PLAN (Personal Localized Alerting Network) by the end of this year. The system sends targeted text-like messages to mobile phones in the event of a disaster or terrorist attack, providing residents with timely information about imminent safety threats in their area. The system can send three types of alerts, including presidential alerts, and will be expanded to the rest of the country by April 2012. A special chip is required to receive the notifications, but many ""smart"" phones already have this technology. This system aims to improve communication during emergencies, especially in areas with high mobile phone traffic and downed cell phone towers, as seen during the September 11 attacks."
"Han Han, a 27-year-old Chinese writer, has become a prominent voice for his generation, known as the ""post-80's generation."" He rose to fame with novels about angst-ridden characters and gained international recognition with his blog, which covers topics such as government handling of the Sichuan earthquake and school stabbings. Han balances his writing to avoid censorship, saying that even though China has improved its freedom of speech, writing is still a risk. His attitude and writing resonate with millions of disaffected youth, making him a popular and recognizable blogger in China. Han's focus is on artistic freedom rather than politics, and he hopes for an unregulated environment for artists. He views the Chinese government as outdated and sometimes stupid, but not evil, except when it comes to perceived threats."
"Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad met in Damascus for a two-day meeting aimed at improving cooperation between the two countries. They expressed a desire to ""open new horizons"" and ""bet on a better future"" for both countries and peoples, focusing on economic and trade cooperation. The meeting marked a significant step in thawing relations between the two nations, which have been strained since Syria's withdrawal from Lebanon in 2005 following the assassination of Saad Hariri's father, Rafik Hariri. The leaders avoided discussing the sensitive topic of the assassination and other past issues, instead choosing to focus on building a positive relationship for the future."
"In Karachi, Pakistan, 24 workers at the Landhi garments factory collapsed during an exorcism to remove a suspected ""genie"" or ""evil spirit"" from the building. The factory owners had called a spiritualist to perform the exorcism, but doctors later determined that the workers were experiencing mass hysteria, likely caused by fear of the exorcism. The workers were taken to Jinnah hospital, where doctors found no evidence of supernatural influence or a gas leak. Instead, they diagnosed a temporary neurological condition triggered by fear, which caused the workers to faint and believe they were possessed."
English golfer Mark Foster fired a 6-under-par 66 to lead the Johnnie Walker Championship at Gleneagles. His impressive round kept him in contention for a spot on the Seve Trophy team, which will compete against Britain and Ireland in September.

"Father Gabriele Amorth, the 85-year-old chief exorcist of the Roman Catholic Church, believes that the devil can literally possess people and that it's his job to perform exorcisms to liberate them. With over 70,000 exorcisms performed in his career, he distinguishes between possession and temptation, stating that pedophiles are tempted by the devil, not possessed. Amorth claims he has never done an exorcism on a child molester, but has performed exorcisms on priests who were ""molested by the devil."" He emphasizes that these individuals need to be converted to God through confession and repentance, rather than exorcism. Amorth also believes that no one is immune to possession, not even holy people or saints, but he sees no evil in the Vatican, only good and holy people."
"Research has shown that honey, particularly Manuka honey, has powerful antibacterial properties. A study by Sydney University found that it can effectively combat antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Associate Professor Dee Carter suggests that honey-based products could replace antibiotic creams on wounds and equipment, prolonging the life of antibiotics. The exact mechanism behind honey's antibacterial properties is unknown, but a compound called methylglyoxal is believed to interact with other compounds to prevent bacteria from developing resistance.

An Australian company, Medi Bioactive Honey Company, has produced a medical-grade antibacterial honey called Berringa, which has twice the antibacterial content of normal Manuka honey. This product has been launched in the UK. Experts agree that honey's antibacterial properties are due to its high sugar content, low water content, low pH, and ability to produce hydrogen peroxide. The National Health Service in Britain has licensed the use of Manuka-honey wound dressings and sterilized medical grade Manuka-honey creams since 2004."
"Villarreal has parted ways with manager Ernesto Valverde after a 2-0 home defeat to Osasuna. Valverde, who was only at the club for a short time, accepted full responsibility for the team's poor performance. The club has appointed reserve coach Juan Carlos Garrido as the interim manager until the end of the season.

Meanwhile, Real Valladolid has sacked coach Jose Luis Mendilibar after a 1-1 draw with Almeria left the team in a precarious position in the league. Mendilibar's departure makes him the seventh managerial casualty of the Spanish top-flight season. Reserve-team coach Onesimo Sanchez will take over the team."

"Cuba has published the diary of Ernesto ""Che"" Guevara, which he kept during the armed struggle in the Sierra Maestra mountains alongside Fidel Castro. The diary, titled ""Diary of a Combatant,"" covers the period from December 1956 to January 1959, shortly before the rebels declared victory. The book was edited by the Che Guevara Studies Center and published by Ocean Press/Ocean Sur. Some of Guevara's notebooks were missing, but researchers used his 1963 book ""Episodes of the Cuban Revolutionary War"" as a reference. Guevara's diary is intended to show his thoughts and life, as per his widow Aleida March, to prevent distortions of his image. This is the first publication of Guevara's diary over 50 years after the events."
"A 6.3-magnitude earthquake struck Christchurch, New Zealand, on Tuesday, resulting in a death toll of 113, with over 200 people still missing. Police Superintendent Dave Cliff expressed ""grave fears"" for the missing and stated that identifying victims is challenging due to the condition of the bodies found. The quake caused widespread destruction, toppling buildings and buckling streets, and officials have given up hope of rescuing at least 100 people trapped in the Canterbury TV building. A total of 27 Japanese students are among the missing, with some survivors sharing harrowing accounts of their experiences. However, there have been some positive developments, including the rescue of Anne Vos from the rubble of the Pyne Gould building. The quake is part of a larger aftershock sequence following a 7.1-magnitude earthquake that struck the area in September."
US Lt. Gen. Martin Dempsey visited Beirut, Lebanon, to discuss the security crisis with local officials. He assured them that the US will continue to provide military aid to the Lebanese army. The visit was not previously scheduled, and it focused on maintaining US support for the Lebanese government and people. The Lebanese army has been facing battles between pro- and anti-government forces, with over 62 people killed. In response, the army announced it would use force if necessary against armed groups.

A massive emergency effort is underway, with officials warning that the death toll may rise as rescue workers reach outlying villages. US President Barack Obama declared the disaster a major disaster, deploying resources and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to aid in the response.
"In 2010, Ben Harper, Joseph Arthur, and Dhani Harrison came together at the Carriage House studio in Los Angeles with no pre-written songs. They spent three days creating the nine acoustic tracks that make up their album ""As I Call You Down"" under the name Fistful of Mercy. The trio worked together, writing and arranging music, and then retreated to different parts of the studio to write lyrics. After completing the acoustic tracks, they added percussion and other instruments, including slide guitar and bass, with the help of legendary drummer Jim Keltner. The collaboration resulted in a unique album that showcases the harmonies and talents of the three musicians, who will tour together in October."

A taxidermy school owner, Jerry Ayer, in Blanco, Texas, is receiving unwanted attention for a dead, 30-pound, mostly hairless coyote-like creature he possesses. The creature has sparked a media frenzy, with some speculating it's a chupacabra, a mythical creature said to drain the blood of its victims. Ayer believes the creature is genetically defective and has been receiving 50 phone calls, death threats, and is struggling to teach at his taxidermy school. He plans to have the creature stuffed and mounted, with Texas A&M University taking tissue samples to determine its exact identity, which may end up in a museum.
Washington Wizards point guard Gilbert Arenas has admitted to drawing unloaded guns in the team locker room on December 21. Arenas claims he was only joking, but acknowledges it was a mistake. He has cooperated with the investigation, meeting with federal prosecutors and D.C. metropolitan police. Arenas' teammate Javaris Crittenton's agent, Mark Bartelstein, maintains his client's innocence and has not scheduled a meeting with authorities. The incident is still under investigation by the U.S. Attorney's Office and D.C. law enforcement. Arenas has apologized to the league, his teammates, and fans, promising to do better in the future.
Zimbabwe's inflation rate has reached a world-high 11.2 million percent, according to the country's Central Statistical Office. The inflation rate has surged from 2.2 million percent in May, despite government price controls. The finance minister, Samuel Mumbengegwi, attributes the rising inflation to global factors such as bio-fuel and sanctions. However, analysts believe the official inflation rate is conservative, with one bank estimating it to be over 20 million percent. The economic crisis, caused by land reform and President Robert Mugabe's disputed reelection, has destroyed Zimbabwe's currency and led to widespread poverty, unemployment, and a brain drain. A regional summit failed to persuade Zimbabwe's political parties to form a government of national unity, exacerbating the economic meltdown.
Brazil's Foreign Minister Celso Amorim stated that his country will not support U.S. pressure to impose sanctions on Iran over its nuclear program. Amorim met with U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in Brasilia and expressed Brazil's desire for a world without nuclear arms and proliferation. The U.S. is seeking sanctions on Iran's Revolutionary Guards Corps, focusing on banking, shipping, and insurance sectors, and is trying to gain support from Russia and China. Clinton believes Iran will not engage in negotiations until sanctions are in place, while Amorim thinks there is still time for talks and a uranium swap deal remains a possibility.
Japan's 77-year-old Emperor Akihito has been hospitalized with bronchitis and a fever. This is his second hospitalization this year, following medical treatment for coronary artery tests in February. As a precaution, the Cabinet has temporarily elevated Crown Prince Naruhito to the role of emperor, granting him full powers and responsibilities. Emperor Akihito, who has been the 125th Emperor of Japan since 1989, is a ceremonial figure with minimal involvement in day-to-day government affairs. However, he has broken from precedent in the past, including giving a historic speech after Japan's devastating earthquake and tsunami earlier this year, in which he encouraged citizens to support those affected by the disaster.

A devastating mudslide and flood hit Zhouqu, China, on Saturday night, resulting in over 702 confirmed deaths and over 1,000 reported missing. Rescue efforts are ongoing, but the grim reality is setting in as recovery teams pull out more bodies and the threat of disease and epidemic looms due to the heat and lack of clean water. The situation is further complicated by pockets of air beneath the mud, making it difficult for rescue teams to navigate. The government has delivered aid, including 7,000 tents, but many survivors remain without shelter due to lack of flat ground. With more rain forecast in the next few days, the situation is expected to worsen.
"An oil painting, ""Portrait of a Musician Playing a Bagpipe,"" created in 1632 by an unknown artist, was returned to the estate of Max Stern, a Jewish art dealer who was forced to sell his artwork under Nazi Germany in 1937. Stern, who had no heirs, established the Max Stern Art Restitution Project to benefit universities in Canada and Israel. The painting had changed hands several times, with its current owner, Lawrence Steigrad, a New York art dealer, unaware of its past. Immigration agents discovered the painting's history through a Holocaust claims office and seized it from Steigrad's gallery, returning it to the estate on Holocaust Remembrance Day."
The Taliban has taken control of Pakistan's Swat Valley and a neighboring district, Buner, after implementing Islamic law, also known as sharia law, in the region. Swat Valley, once a popular tourist destination, has been plagued by violence and terrorism since 2008. The Pakistani government reached a peace deal with the Taliban earlier this year, allowing the imposition of sharia law, which includes strict rules such as veils for women, beards for men, and a ban on music and television. The Taliban's interpretation of sharia law also includes severe consequences for those who disobey, including lashings, beheadings, and public hangings. The takeover of Buner brings the Taliban closer to the Pakistani capital, Islamabad, and has sparked protests in the city of Karachi.

The school is also implementing programs to promote diversity and understanding among its students. The investigation may lead to charges with enhanced penalties for a hate crime.
US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is planning her first overseas trip, bypassing Europe, and instead heading to Asia. She is expected to visit China, Japan, and South Korea, with possible additional stops in Southeast Asia. This decision reflects the Obama administration's desire for a broader partnership with China and a commitment to resolving the North Korean nuclear issue. Clinton's trip also aims to strengthen ties with Tokyo and Seoul. Traditionally, US secretaries of state make Europe or the Middle East their first official trip, but Clinton's itinerary is unique due to Vice President Biden's current trip to Europe and other diplomatic engagements.

US President George W. Bush vetoed a bill to expand the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) for the second time, citing concerns that it would encourage families to leave private insurance for the federally funded program. The bill aimed to cover an additional 4 million children, paid for by a 61-cent-per-pack increase in the federal cigarette tax. The veto message called for Congress to extend funding for the current program, which covers 6 million children. Despite bipartisan support, the bill fell short of the necessary two-thirds majorities in both the House and Senate to override the veto.
Fernando Alonso, a two-time Formula One world champion, has refused to comment on Renault's upcoming FIA hearing regarding alleged race-fixing at the 2008 Singapore Grand Prix. Alonso won the race after teammate Nelson Piquet Jr. crashed, which is at the center of the investigation.

Meanwhile, Ferrari announced a new title sponsor, Banco Santander, for the next five years.
A former hospital employee, Kristen Diane Parker, has admitted to secretly injecting herself with fentanyl and replacing patients' injections with used syringes filled with saline solution at Rose Medical Center in Denver. She worked as a surgical technician from October 2008 to April 2009 and had hepatitis C, which she contracted through heroin use. Nine patients who had surgery during that time have tested positive for hepatitis C, and investigators are looking into whether they contracted the virus from Parker. Parker is in federal custody facing three drug-related charges and could face up to 20 years in prison or life in prison if a patient dies due to her actions. The hospital is contacting 4,700 patients who had surgery during Parker's employment, although officials do not believe many were exposed.
"US Attorney General Eric Holder testified before a House subcommittee on the Justice Department budget but was instead questioned about secret documents related to alleged torture during the Bush administration. 

Rep. Frank Wolf (R-Virginia) demanded that Holder release still-secret documents, which former Vice President Dick Cheney claims detail valuable intelligence gained from harsh interrogation techniques. However, Holder stated that he is not familiar with these documents and does not know if they exist.

The administration has already released four documents authorizing waterboarding and other controversial methods, which Republicans criticized and Democrats praised. 

Representatives from liberal organizations, such as the American Civil Liberties Union, urged Holder to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate and press charges against Bush administration officials responsible for the use of torture. Holder indicated that he is waiting for a pending report before making any decisions."
"A Russian missile cruiser, the ""Peter the Great,"" intercepted three pirate ships off the coast of Somalia and detained 10 Somali pirates. The pirates were armed with various weapons and had a GPS receiver, money, and food on board. They were also found to be under the influence of drugs. The cruiser had been tracking the pirates after a helicopter spotted them attempting to hijack an Iranian fishing vessel.

The crew of 23, consisting of 18 Filipinos and 5 South Koreans, was reportedly unharmed."
The California Supreme Court has ruled that same-sex marriage is constitutional, paving the way for California to become the second US state to legalize such marriages. On June 17, same-sex couples in California may be able to obtain marriage licenses. The state Department of Public Health has released new marriage license forms, but the current forms still contain outdated language. Opponents of same-sex marriage are considering a constitutional amendment to be placed on the November ballot. This ruling follows Massachusetts, which legalized same-sex marriage in 2004, but has since restricted non-resident marriages. Other states offer varying levels of recognition and rights to same-sex couples.
"In northeastern Mexico, authorities discovered eight mass graves containing at least 59 bodies in the town of San Fernando. The investigation began after a report of a bus kidnapping in late March. 11 suspects were arrested, and 5 hostages were rescued. Forensic investigators will attempt to identify the victims and determine if they are the missing bus passengers. 

The Tamaulipas governor condemned the violence, and Mexican President Felipe Calderon's office called it a ""cowardly"" act by criminal organizations. Amnesty International criticized the Mexican government for failing to address the country's public security crisis and protect its citizens and migrants. The nationalities of the victims are unknown, but the area is known for its high level of drug trafficking activity, primarily controlled by the Gulf cartel and the Zetas cartel."
"A former hospital employee, Kristen Diane Parker, has admitted to secretly injecting herself with fentanyl and using unclean syringes on patients while working as a surgical technician at Rose Medical Center in Denver from 2008 to 2009. She had hepatitis C, which she believes she contracted through using heroin. Nine patients who had surgery during her employment have tested positive for hepatitis C, and investigators are looking into whether they contracted the virus from Parker.

Rose Medical Center is contacting 4,700 patients who had surgery during Parker's employment, while Audubon Ambulatory Surgical Center is contacting an additional 1,200 patients who may have been infected during Parker's time there.

Hepatitis C is a contagious liver disease that can lead to cirrhosis or liver cancer, and hospital officials are taking a cautious approach to notify patients who may have been exposed."
The UK is withdrawing nearly all its troops from Iraq, with the majority leaving by the end of the week. The remaining 100-150 troops will be relocated to Kuwait.

The UK hopes to eventually secure a new agreement with the Iraqi government.

The pirates were found in a powerless skiff with rocket-propelled grenades and AK-47s, approximately 75 nautical miles off the coast of Yemen. After receiving medical treatment, the crew turned them over to Yemen's coast guard on Friday morning.

Scientists have detected new cracks in the Wilkins Ice Shelf in Antarctica, which is imminently close to breaking away from the Antarctic Peninsula. The ice shelf has been experiencing significant changes, losing 14% of its size over the past year. The European Space Agency released satellite images showing the expanding cracks, which are threatening to separate the ice shelf from Charcot Island. While the ice shelf's breakaway will not cause a rise in sea levels due to it being already floating, it may impact local plants and animals. Scientists are investigating whether global climate change is the cause of the ice shelf's collapse, which is a concern given the Antarctic Peninsula's recent history of ice shelf retreats.

A contentious closed-door UN Security Council meeting took place on Tuesday, with Russia criticizing France's decision to airlift weapons to rebel forces in Libya. France had previously stated that the weapons drops were no longer necessary as the opposition forces had become organized enough to procure their own arms. However, Russia argued that France had violated a UN resolution by sending weapons.

A study by The Guardian has found that Manchester United receives more injury-time at Old Trafford than their English Premier League rivals, particularly when they are trailing. When United is winning, the average stoppage time added is 191.35 seconds, but when they are drawing or losing, it's 257.17 seconds. This disparity suggests that referees allow the match to continue until Manchester United can equalize or score the winner. The study also found that United's average stoppage time is lower than that of their top-four rivals, Liverpool, Arsenal, and Chelsea. The trend has been observed in recent seasons, including the 2007-08 season and the current season, with Manchester City manager Mark Hughes expressing his frustration over the extra time in a recent match.

"Yemen's Prime Minister Ali Mujawar defended his government, saying that the country's democratic system makes it unlikely to experience Egypt-style protests. He stated that Yemen has held elections and is a democratic regime, contradicting the demands of thousands of anti-government demonstrators who gathered in the capital, Sanaa. The protesters, who are seeking economic opportunities and a government that represents them, are inspired by the uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt. President Ali Abdullah Saleh has announced that he will not seek re-election in 2013 and has invited his opponents to engage in dialogue. However, Prime Minister Mujawar warned that if the opposition rejects this initiative, ""democratic life in Yemen will continue."" He also expressed concern that the political turmoil could benefit al Qaeda, which has taken advantage of Yemen's poverty, unemployment, and difficult terrain."

Tsvangirai claims he won the presidential election against Robert Mugabe, but the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission ruled for a runoff vote on June 27. Tsvangirai's party, the MDC, has requested international observers to monitor the election, which the government has refused. The MDC has reported kidnappings, torture, and violence against opposition members, with two members found dead in Harare. A government official denied any involvement in the alleged plot, accusing the MDC of seeking international sympathy. Tsvangirai is expected to visit victims of post-election violence in hospitals.
According to the Lundberg Survey, gas prices in the US have dropped significantly, with the average price of self-serve, unleaded gasoline dipping below $2 for the first time since March 2005. The average price on Friday was $1.97, a 33-cent decrease in two weeks. Diesel prices also fell, averaging $2.93 and dropping below $3 for the first time since September 2007. The decline in gas prices is attributed to lower crude oil prices, reduced demand, and low refining margins. However, if crude oil prices do not continue to fall, the price crash may be nearing its end.
"Director Joseph McGinty Nichol, also known as ""McG,"" has directed the summer blockbuster ""Terminator Salvation,"" which features real machines to increase realism. This decision was made to honor the late special effects supervisor Stan Winston, who passed away during filming. The cast, including Christian Bale, Bryce Dallas Howard, and Anton Yelchin, believe that audiences are sophisticated enough to tell the difference between CGI and real objects. They used real robots and sets, and even blew them up in real life, resulting in some cast members losing their eyebrows. The use of real objects was intended to create a more immersive experience for the audience and to stay true to Winston's tradition of building props."
"New York has become the second state, after Maine, to require landlords to disclose bedbug infestation history in apartment buildings to potential tenants. This ""right-to-know"" law aims to protect renters from unexpected infestations. The New York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development issued 4,811 bedbug violation notices in 2009, a significant increase from 82 in the 2003-2004 fiscal year. However, actual bedbug cases are likely underreported, as many infestations in private residences and commercial buildings go unreported. Nationally, the incidence of bedbug infestations has tripled since 2005, with recent cases affecting high-end retailers, movie theaters, and office buildings. This new law in New York aims to provide renters with essential information to make informed decisions when signing a lease."
"Maryland officials have implemented an eco-friendly solution to control plant growth on state highways while protecting threatened bog turtles. 40 bearded goats have been deployed to an enclosed area for a week and will continue to work until September. They will return next spring as part of the ""Smart, Green and Growing"" legislative package. This pilot program aims to reduce the state's greenhouse gas emissions by 25% by 2020 and is significantly cheaper than traditional mowing programs. The goats were chosen over other herbivorous animals due to their gentle nature and ability to coexist with the bog turtles. This initiative is not unique, as similar projects have been launched in Hempstead, New York, Vail, Colorado, and Denver. Environmental activists have praised the measure as innovative and worth implementing."

A US federal judge has ordered the city of New York to implement a court-appointed monitor to prevent discrimination in the hiring of firefighters. The decision, made by Judge Nicholas Garaufis, requires the city to reassess its hiring policies and practices to ensure fairness and equal opportunities for all applicants. The order comes after years of litigation, with the US Department of Justice filing a complaint in 2007 alleging that the Fire Department of New York's hiring exams negatively affected black and Hispanic applicants. The judge acknowledged the city's improvement in minority recruiting, but stated that discriminatory testing procedures have kept many minority applicants from being hired. The city has been ordered to take remedial steps to fix discriminatory hiring practices and the court monitor will be in place for at least 10 years to ensure compliance. The city intends to appeal the decision.
Tottenham manager Harry Redknapp called for artificial pitches to be banned in the Champions League after his team lost 3-2 to Young Boys in the playoffs. He claimed that the plastic surface caused injuries to several players, including Jermain Defoe, who was forced off with a groin injury. However, UEFA rejected Redknapp's suggestion, citing their regulations that only the Champions League final must be played on grass. Article 13.08 of the UEFA regulations states that matches can be played on artificial turf if it meets the FIFA 2-Star Standard, which the pitch in Switzerland did. Despite the loss, Tottenham remain favorites for the return leg at White Hart Lane.

The US House of Representatives voted 406-19 to repeal the antitrust exemption granted to health insurance companies, a law in place since World War II. The repeal aims to promote competition and reduce consumer costs in the health care industry. President Obama supports the repeal, saying it's a complementary step towards broader changes in the insurance market. The exemption has allowed health insurance companies to divide the country into geographic zones, creating local monopolies. Industry defenders argue that insurers are still subject to state regulations and that the impact of the repeal is overblown. The bill now moves to the Senate, where the previous version of the health care bill did not include the exemption repeal.

Fighting has resumed in the disputed oil-rich town of Abyei in Sudan, threatening to reignite a civil war that ended three years ago. The conflict, between the Sudanese military and the Sudan People's Liberation Army, has resulted in the destruction of the town and the displacement of 30,000 to 50,000 people. The UN Secretary General, Ban Ki-moon, has expressed concern that the situation could undo the progress made in the Comprehensive Peace Agreement, which ended a 22-year civil war that killed 2 million people and displaced 4 million others. The ongoing violence in Abyei is an impasse over the town's boundaries, a major reason the peace agreement has not been fully implemented. This conflict is separate from the violence in the Darfur region of western Sudan, where nearly 300,000 people have been killed and 2.5 million displaced in the last five years.

An 18-year-old undocumented Guatemalan immigrant, Juan Gonzalez, is awaiting a heart transplant at a hospital in Atlanta. He was working as a dishwasher in Rome, Georgia, to support his family back home when he was diagnosed with a chronically weak heart. After CNN aired a story about his situation, the Larry King Cardiac Foundation helped get him transferred to a hospital in Atlanta for evaluation.

"In a recent interview with CBS' ""60 Minutes,"" President Obama discussed several key decisions he's made since taking office. He stated that sending 17,000 troops to Afghanistan was the hardest decision he's made, as it had to be made before a strategic review was completed.

"Casey Anthony, a 22-year-old Florida woman, has been charged with the premeditated murder of her 3-year-old daughter, Caylee. Prosecutors have decided not to seek the death penalty, citing that it's not in the best interest of the state. Instead, Anthony faces a maximum sentence of life in prison. 

The case gained national attention after Caylee's disappearance in June, and Anthony's conflicting statements to police raised suspicions. Evidence against her includes cadaver dogs detecting a scent of death in her car, air quality tests showing human decomposition and chloroform in the trunk, and a neighbor reporting that she asked to borrow a shovel. Anthony's computer searches for information on chloroform and missing children also raised concerns."
Jury selection in the Casey Anthony trial, who is charged with the murder of her 2-year-old daughter Caylee, continued in Clearwater, Florida.

Meanwhile, Casey's parents are trying to trademark their granddaughter's name and have sent a demand letter to an online retailer selling products with the name, in an attempt to prevent unauthorized use and potential libel.
An Indonesian court sentenced former tax official Gayus Tambunan to seven years in prison and a fine of $30,000 for corruption. The verdict was less than the 20 years demanded by prosecutors, who plan to appeal. Gayus cooperated with police to expose corruption in the Indonesian judiciary system but claims the case was influenced by various parties to make him look like a public enemy. His case highlighted rampant corruption in the judiciary, tax office, and immigration office.

He admitted to bribing guards to escape prison at least 68 times and using fake passports to travel. The case has sparked calls for reform and prompted the president to investigate dozens of companies linked to Gayus.

A recent CNN poll has found that Americans' concerns about terrorism have reached an all-time low since the 9/11 attacks. Only 35% of Americans believe a terrorist attack in the US is likely in the next few weeks, down from 41% last summer. The poll also shows that the Iraq war remains unpopular, with 68% of voters opposing it. This may be a concern for John McCain, who has highlighted his national security credentials, as the poll suggests that voters are focusing more on domestic issues like the economy. Additionally, the poll's findings on President Bush's low job approval rating (30% approve, 68% disapprove) may further challenge McCain's efforts to distance himself from the outgoing president.

Aokigahara, a dense forest at the foot of Mount Fuji in Japan, has gained a dark reputation as a site for suicides, with 50-100 reported each year. A geologist named Azusa Hayono, who has studied the forest for over 30 years, has become a counselor to those contemplating death. He explained that Japan's achievement-based culture creates feelings of inadequacy, leading some citizens to seek escape in the forest. The forest's eerie atmosphere and the numerous dead bodies Azusa has encountered make his presence there seem surreal. The story sheds light on Japan's cultural pressures and how they contribute to the country's high suicide rate.
"Northern Ireland's water supply is in a ""precarious position"" after multiple major water pipes burst due to a rapid thaw following record low temperatures. The Northern Ireland Water interim chairman, Padraic White, described the company's response as ""unacceptable.""

On the economy, Obama described the stimulus package as a ""tourniquet"" that prevented the recession from worsening, but warned that complete recovery would take time. He also addressed the controversy surrounding his healthcare overhaul, denying that public anger was driven by racism. Instead, he attributed the opposition to a typical response to significant change during times of economic uncertainty."
"The United Nations' REDD (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation) program aims to prevent deforestation and forest degradation in developing countries by providing incentives for countries to preserve their forests. The program values standing trees more than cut ones, allowing countries to earn rewards for not cutting their forests. This approach recognizes the importance of rainforests in capturing carbon, regulating weather, and supporting biodiversity. REDD proposes marketing and paying for various forest services, benefiting marginalized communities.

While critics argue that the program allows richer countries to buy their way out of emissions obligations and that measuring carbon storage is difficult, Yemi Katerere, head of the U.N.-REDD program, believes that an imperfect program is better than none. He emphasizes that REDD offers the greatest mitigation potential at an affordable price and is the most cost-effective solution in the short term."
A 10-year-old boy, Lashaun Armstrong, escaped from a sinking minivan in the Hudson River after his mother, Lashanda Armstrong, drove it into the water.

The 10-year-old boy, who swam to shore and was rescued, is expected to face long-term trauma and potential behavioral issues. An autopsy is scheduled for the four bodies, and the incident is expected to have a lasting impact on the community.

An investigation by the center revealed a complaint was made several years ago, which was reported to the FBI. Ismail believes Hassan and Yaghi were susceptible to a message of violence, which he says sounded ""cool and exciting"" to them."

British Airways is facing a significant crisis due to the global economic downturn. The airline has reported a record annual loss of Â£400 million and is planning to reduce capacity by 4% next winter by parking up to 16 aircraft. To mitigate this, the airline is asking thousands of staff to work for up to four weeks without pay, with the option to work during this period. However, a union spokesperson has expressed concerns that staff cannot afford to work for free and that the airline's chief executive, Willie Walsh, earns significantly more than its employees. The airline's passenger numbers have fallen 4.3% and it is losing customers to cheaper rivals, leading to a shift in strategy to offer lower fares and sacrifice profit per seat.

Daniel Domscheit-Berg, a leading spokesman for WikiLeaks, is stepping down due to organizational shortcomings and clashes with the group's founder, Julian Assange. Domscheit-Berg cited the website's rapid growth and lack of restructuring as a major issue, leading to inefficiencies and overwork. He also expressed frustration with Assange's increasing concentration of resources on large leaks and his refusal to take a backseat role following rape and molestation allegations.

US and NATO-led forces in Afghanistan accidentally killed nine civilians, including some children, in a strike on Tuesday in the Darah-Ye Pech district of Kunar province. The incident occurred after insurgents fired rockets at a base used by coalition troops. Gen. David Petraeus apologized for the tragedy, stating that there was an error in the hand-off between identifying the location of insurgents and the attack helicopters. This is the second incident in less than 10 days in the same province, with 64 civilians killed in a previous joint operation.

"The debate over whether the sport should be called ""football"" or ""soccer"" continues. The term ""soccer"" originated in England in the 1880s as a slang for ""association football"" to differentiate it from rugby football. Despite popular belief, ""soccer"" is a British term, not an American one. The sport was initially referred to as ""football"" in the United States, but the name changed over time to the United States Soccer Football Association and eventually the United States Soccer Federation. The debate remains, with both terms being used, and even the sport's governing body, FIFA, seems to be open to both options."

China's government is implementing new measures to combat surging inflation, which has reached a 25-month high of 4.4 percent. The measures include food subsidies, price limits, and stricter punishment for food speculation and hoarding. As a result, many mainland Chinese are crossing the border into Hong Kong to buy necessities such as meat, produce, and household items, taking advantage of lower prices. In Hong Kong, prices are generally lower due to its pegged currency to the US dollar. McDonald's is also raising prices in China by up to 15 cents per item, but keeping them lower in Hong Kong. The Chinese government has already sold large quantities of pork and sugar from reserves to stabilize food prices, but inflation remains a concern due to strong capital flows into the country.

I will tell you my opinion; I'm not going to channel my husband."" The State Department explained that Clinton's reaction was likely due to the question being asked in a setting where she was about to visit a region affected by the use of rape as a weapon of war."

A cholera epidemic in Zimbabwe has resulted in 1,937 deaths and affected nearly 40,000 people. The World Health Organization (WHO) attributes the spread of the disease to Harare's failure to import water-treating chemicals, leading residents to use contaminated water sources.

International aid has been deployed to combat the disease, but the situation remains dire, with the health minister warning that the epidemic could worsen during the rainy season. The power-sharing deal between President Robert Mugabe and rival Morgan Tsvangirai has yet to take effect, hindering efforts to address the humanitarian and economic crisis.

1. Open more parliament seats to political parties
2. Consider canceling the emergency law
3. Abolish military tribunals

"President Barack Obama referred to the need for a new ""Sputnik moment"" in the US, echoing the Kennedy-era New Frontier and the vision of Steely Dan's ""I.G.Y."" song. He proposed government investment in new technologies to create jobs. 

Historically, the Space Race had a significant impact on the economy. It led to the miniaturization of electronics, which fueled the computer revolution and the development of the Internet. Other products, such as cordless drills and car navigation systems, were also linked to the space program.

The US semiconductor industry grew rapidly due to NASA and military technology, with sales of $115 billion and over 200,000 employees. The commercial satellite industry, which was nonexistent before the 1960s, had revenue of over $90 billion by 2003, employing over 576,000 people.

Overall, Obama's proposal for government investment in new technologies is supported by the success of the space program, but it will likely lead to a debate about the role of government in the economy."

The US Supreme Court has blocked a lower court order that would have required Ohio Secretary of State Jennifer Brunner to update the state's voter registration database. The database contains information from 200,000 newly registered voters whose Social Security numbers or driver's license numbers do not match their names. Brunner, a Democrat, had filed an emergency appeal after a 6th US Circuit Court of Appeals ruling sided with the state Republican Party, which alleged widespread voter fraud in Ohio. The Supreme Court's decision allows Brunner to continue preparing for the November election without implementing the lower court's order. The state Republican Party claims that Brunner's actions could lead to fraudulent votes, while Brunner argues that the decision protects the voting rights of all Ohioans.

"Anti-government protesters in Bangkok, Thailand, have been holding demonstrations against Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva's government. The protesters, known as ""red shirts"" due to their clothing, are supporters of former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, who was ousted in a 2006 military coup. They demand that Abhisit, whom they claim was not democratically elected, call new elections.

To draw attention to their cause, the protesters collected 1,000 liters of blood through a drive and poured a small amount at the government's headquarters. If their demands are not met, they plan to collect more blood and target the ruling party's headquarters and the prime minister's residence.

The protests have been largely peaceful, but they have had a significant impact on tourism, with estimates suggesting a 20% drop in visitors and a 50% cancellation rate among Chinese visitors. Abhisit has refused to dissolve parliament, stating that he will listen to the protesters but will not accede to their demands."

To pay, users select ""touch to pay"" and hold up their mobile device screen to a 2-D scanner at the register. An Android app is in development, but no release date has been announced. Starbucks chose barcode scanning over near-field communication technology due to its limited availability, but plans to adapt once more users are on board. The company believes its customers will appreciate the faster payment option and expects adoption to spread through word of mouth."

The recorders, also known as black boxes, stopped emitting acoustic signals after 30 days, but investigators continued searching for 10 more days. As the signals are expected to stop, a French oceanographic ship, ""Pourquoi Pas?"", will take over the search using diving equipment and towed sonar. The search area is challenging due to its mountainous ocean floor, ranging from 3,280 to 15,091 feet deep. The goal is to recover the recorders, which are crucial for understanding the cause of the crash that killed all 228 people on board."

A cholera epidemic in Zimbabwe has resulted in nearly 2,000 deaths and affected around 40,000 people. The disease has spread to neighboring countries, including South Africa and Botswana. The main cause of the epidemic is Zimbabwe's failure to import water-treating chemicals, leading to residents relying on contaminated water sources. The country's economic crisis, characterized by shortages of food, fuel, and electricity, has exacerbated the situation.

A scholar, Robert Weisbrot, suggests that President Obama can learn from the successes and mistakes of President Lyndon Johnson's Great Society, a series of legislative attempts in the 1960s to address poverty, racial injustice, and environmental issues. However, Weisbrot notes that the current circumstances are different, with a collapsing economy, bitter partisanship, and a skeptical public. He emphasizes that Obama should not try to replicate Johnson's approach, which included over-promising and setting unrealistic expectations. Weisbrot believes that Johnson's optimistic rhetoric, while effective in passing legislation, ultimately led to disillusionment when the promised Utopia did not materialize.

Israel has apologized to Egypt over the killing of five Egyptian border guards in August. The incident occurred during an Israeli pursuit of militants who had crossed from Egyptian territory to attack Israeli civilians, killing eight people. An investigation by Israeli and Egyptian officials found that the border guards were killed by Israeli fire. Israel's apology was seen as an olive branch to the transitional Egyptian government, which has strained relations with Israel in recent months. The apology was issued as part of a deal to release Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit, who was captured by Hamas over five years ago. Israel's Defense Minister Ehud Barak expressed regret for the deaths of the Egyptian guards, while Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reaffirmed Israel's commitment to its 1979 peace agreement with Egypt.
Casey Anthony, who was acquitted of murdering her 2-year-old daughter Caylee in 2011, has been ordered to serve a year of probation for check fraud. The Fifth District Court of Appeal in Florida ruled that Anthony cannot avoid serving her 2010 sentence due to an administrative error. The court upheld a judge's verbal order, stating that Anthony should have reported for probation after her release from jail in July. Anthony's lawyers argued that she had already served her sentence while in custody, but the appeals court disagreed, ruling that she must serve her probation in Orange County, Florida.
The Jackson family has expressed interest in burying Michael Jackson at Neverland Ranch, his former home in California. However, Santa Barbara County officials have not been contacted about the possibility, and a formal application is required for burial on private land. To proceed, the family needs a certificate of authority from the state and approval from the county. The county has allowed burials outside cemeteries in the past, such as former President Ronald Reagan's burial at his presidential library. The family is divided on the issue, with Jermaine Jackson supporting the idea and their father, Joe Jackson, opposing it.

The library has digitized its records, including a yellowed ledger from the 18th century, which revealed the missing books and their connection to President Washington."
The remains of 2nd Lt. Martin P. Murray, a 21-year-old Massachusetts airman missing in action from World War II, have been identified and will be returned to his family for burial. Murray was part of a B-24D Liberator crew that took off on October 27, 1943, from New Guinea, but went missing after being told to land due to poor weather. Despite multiple searches, the aircraft was not found until 2007, when a team from the Joint POW/MIA Accounting Command excavated the site and discovered identification tags and human remains. Forensic analysis, including DNA testing, confirmed Murray's identity. His remains will be buried on Saturday in Marshfield, Massachusetts. The identification of Murray's remains brings the number of unrecovered American service members from World War II down to 74,000 from the original 79,000.

Villas-Boas, who guided Porto to a treble last season, has signed a three-year contract and will become the youngest manager in the English Premier League. He replaces Carlo Ancelotti, who was sacked in May after a trophy-less campaign.

A U.N.-backed court in Cambodia has put three top Khmer Rouge leaders on trial for their roles in the regime's 1975-1979 rule, which resulted in the deaths of approximately 1.7 million people, roughly a quarter of the population. The defendants, Ieng Sary, Khieu Samphon, and Nuon Chea, are all in their 80s. They face charges of crimes against humanity, genocide, and other atrocities. The regime, led by Pol Pot, aimed to create a communist utopia but instead forced people into a living hell, abolishing currency, education, and modern medicine, and torturing and killing those suspected of being disloyal.

Zimbabwe's prison congestion is expected to ease after President Robert Mugabe agreed to pardon over 1,500 prisoners due to overcrowding. The decision was made to alleviate the challenges faced by the Prison Service, which has been struggling to provide basic needs to inmates. Zimbabwe's 42 prisons have a capacity for 13,000 inmates but are currently holding 17,000. The pardon excludes prisoners with serious charges such as rape, armed robbery, and murder. Prison officials have faced difficulties in supplying adequate rations and paying bills, leading to issues such as water disconnections, which raises concerns about the spread of diseases like cholera.
Ford Motor Company Executive Chairman Bill Ford Jr. believes the auto industry is on track to eliminate CO2 emissions, but is concerned about the global gridlock crisis caused by a projected 9 billion population by 2044. He estimates that the number of vehicles on the road will increase from 800 million to 2-3 billion by 2050, leading to significant economic and quality of life issues. To address this, Ford proposes a smarter transportation system using real-time data and connected cars that can communicate with each other. This system would enable features such as automatic routing, parking spot reservations, and efficient travel planning. Ford sees this as a huge opportunity for entrepreneurs to create profitable solutions that preserve the freedom of movement and contribute to economic growth.

The Taiwanese military has deployed helicopters, patrol boats, and divers in the search efforts, and family members of the missing tourists have arrived on the island to aid in the search. The typhoon has also affected the Philippines and China, leaving thousands homeless and causing significant damage.
"Nigeria is making efforts to boost its oil industry by brokering peace with militants and negotiating multibillion-dollar deals with China. The government plans to reform the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation to address corruption and mismanagement allegations. 

In a peace move, hundreds of militants have laid down their arms in exchange for a pardon and a job, with the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta (MEND) agreeing to a cease-fire. 

China is showing interest in investing in Nigeria's oil industry, with the China National Offshore Oil Corporation reportedly negotiating a $30 billion oil deal. 

The fragile peace with militants is expected to help Nigeria reap big dollars from its oil industry, as the government seeks to leverage the situation to attract more investment."
"Joran van der Sloot, a 22-year-old Dutch citizen, has been interrogated by Peruvian police regarding the 2005 disappearance of Natalee Holloway. During the interrogation, van der Sloot claimed to know the location of Holloway's body but refused to reveal it. He stated that he would explain everything to the Aruban police. Van der Sloot is currently in Peruvian custody, having been extradited from Chile, where he confessed to killing Stephany Flores Ramirez in a hotel room registered in his name.

In a separate case, U.S. authorities have charged van der Sloot with extortion and wire fraud for allegedly trying to extort $250,000 from Holloway's mother in exchange for information about her daughter's remains. Van der Sloot received $25,000 in cash and $15,000 via wire transfer from an undercover FBI agent, who was posing as a representative of Holloway's mother. However, van der Sloot admitted to lying about the location of Holloway's body after records showed that the house he claimed to have seen her remains in had not yet been built at the time of her disappearance."
"Nepal's Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal, also known as Prachanda, has resigned due to a serious political crisis. The crisis was triggered by President Ram Baran Yadav's ""unconstitutional"" decision to reinstate the army chief, Gen. Rookmangud Katawal, who was sacked by the government. The government had dismissed Katawal over his refusal to stop recruiting new soldiers despite a peace deal requiring the integration of former Maoist rebels into the security forces. Prachanda, the leader of the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist), cited the dual powers established by the president as unconstitutional and threatening the country's ""infant democracy."""
"DreamWorks Studios, led by Steven Spielberg and Stacey Snider, has secured $875 million in financing from a partnership with Anil Ambani's Reliance BIG Entertainment and the Walt Disney Co. This deal will allow DreamWorks to produce and distribute films independently, with Disney handling distribution and marketing outside of India.

Mexican President Felipe Calderon will visit Ciudad Juarez for the third time since taking office in 2006. The visit comes after a series of violent incidents, including the January 31 killings of 15 people, mostly students, in a house party. The president had previously apologized to the families and promised to involve residents in the strategy against drug-related violence. Despite this, residents have continued to express frustration, with many calling for Calderon's resignation. Recent incidents include the slayings of a business owner and his secretary, and the detention of 20 students found drinking in the street. The violence in Ciudad Juarez is part of a broader national trend, with over 16,000 Mexicans having died in drug-related violence since Calderon declared war on the cartels in 2006.
Billy Mays, a 50-year-old TV pitchman, died in his sleep at his home near Tampa, Florida. The Hillsborough County medical examiner has ruled that the cause of death is likely hypertensive heart disease, not a bump to the head as initially suspected. The autopsy revealed no evidence of exterior or interior head trauma. Toxicology results are still pending, but the medical examiner stated that sudden death can occur with this type of disease. Mays was on a flight that experienced a hard landing the day before his death, but he had told a friend that he was feeling unwell before going to sleep. His wife Deborah Mays released a statement saying that while the cause of death brings some closure, it does not ease the void left by his passing. Mays was famous for fronting products such as OxiClean and Orange Glo in TV commercials.
A class-action lawsuit against Sears has been settled, requiring the company to install safety brackets for free on stoves that may tip over, or provide gift cards or reimbursements of up to $100 to qualifying customers. The settlement affects nearly 4 million customers who bought stoves between July 2000 and September 2007. The safety brackets are designed to prevent accidents, which have caused over 100 deaths or injuries. Sears will also install brackets on all new stoves for free for the next three years. Consumer advocates have hailed the settlement, but some have called for mandatory safety standards for all stove installations, citing that the voluntary standards have been ineffective.

Shatner stated that he has never had a mentor, but has relied on his own efforts to succeed in the entertainment industry."
Ugandan police have arrested and extradited Idephonse Nizeyimana, one of the most wanted suspects from the 1994 Rwandan genocide. The 100-day killing rampage resulted in the loss of an estimated 1 million lives, 10% of Rwanda's population. Nizeyimana, a former captain in the Rwanda Armed Forces, is accused of ordering the execution of Rosalie Gicanda, a former queen of Rwanda and a Tutsi symbol. He was transferred to a UN detention facility in Arusha, Tanzania, where he will be tried by the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda. This marks the second time Uganda has cooperated with the tribunal to make an arrest.
Research has shown that honey, particularly Manuka honey, has powerful antibacterial properties, making it effective against antibiotic-resistant bacteria. A study by Sydney University found that honey could replace antibiotic creams on wounds and prolong the life of antibiotics. The antibacterial properties of honey are attributed to a compound called methylglyoxal and other unknown compounds. Manuka honey is made from bees pollinating the Manuka bush in New Zealand, while a new product, Berringa antibacterial honey, is made from bees pollinating the Australian jellybush and has twice the antibacterial content of normal Manuka honey. The UK's National Health Service has licensed the use of Manuka-honey wound dressings and creams since 2004.
"The US has begun reviewing materials seized from Osama bin Laden's compound in Pakistan. The initial review has found mostly ""aspirational"" planning, but yielded ""real intelligence"" on al-Qaeda's operations. The review team, led by the CIA, is working around the clock to sort through the data, which includes digital, audio, and video files, as well as printed and handwritten materials. The team has found that bin Laden remained an active leader in al-Qaeda, providing strategic instructions to the group. The US believes the bin Laden compound was a command and control center for al-Qaeda. The review is expected to provide insights into how al-Qaeda operates, including how bin Laden communicated and how he ran the organization. The US plans to share some of the intelligence with other relevant nations and parties once they have a better understanding of what they have."

The majority of casualties were caused by anti-government elements, with insurgent attacks increasing by 25% compared to last year. While deaths caused by US troops and their allies decreased by 18%, the number of civilian casualties remains high due to the rise in insurgent attacks. The report also highlights the widespread kidnapping of aid workers, with 134 abducted between June and October, and a British aid worker killed during a rescue attempt by US special forces."
"The US is concerned that Pakistan may have given China access to the high-tech helicopter that crashed during the raid on Osama bin Laden's compound. A US official stated that there is reason to suspect China was given access, but this has not been confirmed. Pakistan's military has denied the allegations, calling it a ""malicious campaign"" against their security forces. News reports suggest that Pakistani authorities allowed Chinese engineers to photograph and take samples from the wreckage of the stealth helicopter. The US has withheld $800 million in aid to Pakistan due to the incident, which strained relations between the two countries."
"A Florida jury has found James ""Bob"" Ward, a 63-year-old millionaire, guilty of second-degree murder for shooting his wife, Diane Ward, in their upscale home in 2009. The victim, 55, was found with a large pool of blood on her head and a.357 Magnum handgun next to her bed. Ward claimed they were the only ones in the house at the time, but his inconsistent statements and demeanor raised suspicions. The prosecution argued that Ward's actions were driven by anger and frustration, while the defense contended that Diane died during a struggle over a loaded gun. The jury delivered the verdict after a week-long trial, and Ward's defense team plans to appeal the decision."
"Abdel Kareem Nabil, a blogger known as Kareem Amer, has been released from a four-year prison sentence in Egypt. He was imprisoned for writing articles that were deemed to be ""disruptive of public order"" and ""inciting hate towards Islam.""

Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab, the suspect behind the failed Christmas Day Northwest Airlines bombing, allegedly spent two months in Yemen before the attack. During this time, he may have been influenced by Al-Iman University, an Islamic university led by Sheikh Abdel Majid al-Zindani, a cleric considered a terrorist by the US. However, students at the university claim that AbdulMutallab was never a student there and that his actions are against Islamic teachings. Al-Zindani, who is free in Yemen, has denied CNN's request for an interview but allowed them to tape at the university. Yemeni authorities have taken a hands-off approach to investigating the university, and it remains unclear if AbdulMutallab was ever a student there.

Tokyo, once known as Edo, has evolved into a futuristic city with a unique blend of tradition and modernity. Despite its high-tech appearance, the city has been shaped by a history of catastrophes, including earthquakes, fires, and bombings. As a result, Tokyo has continuously rebuilt and redeveloped, with a focus on the future. However, beneath its modern facade, the city still maintains a connection to its past, with remnants of old Edo visible in its Shinto heritage, social etiquette, and cultural traditions. Tokyoites appear to be a mix of sober and industrious individuals, but they also have a desire for escapism, as seen in their love of manga, anime, and cosplay. After a period of recession, Tokyo has regained its confidence and is once again a thriving city, with a bright future ahead.

The new currency will be equivalent to the old currency, with the highest note being 500 Zimbabwe dollars. The decision comes as the country struggles with cash shortages, with many people sleeping outside banks in hopes of getting money. The central bank blames Germany for a contract cancellation that led to the cash shortages, which have hindered both corporate and household sectors.

A company, Sail Stadefrance Operating Company (SSOC), has withdrawn from a 30-year lease to manage the Green Point Stadium in Cape Town, South Africa. The company, a partnership between South African and French consortiums, miscalculated the running costs, which were estimated at $6 million per year. As a result, the management of the stadium will transfer to the city in January 2011, potentially leaving residents to cover the $600 million construction costs. Despite this setback, the city's acting executive mayor has assured residents that future events, including a national football match, will take place at the stadium as planned.
Russia plans to construct a new naval base in Abkhazia, a pro-Russian separatist region in Georgia. The base will be located in the port of Ochamchire and will house vessels from Russia's Black Sea fleet. The fleet is currently based in Sevastopol, Ukraine, but its lease agreement expires in 2017.

The investigation into Rennix's death is ongoing, and authorities will look into the possibility of a connection between the two incidents.
Thousands gathered in Hong Kong's Victoria Park to mark the 22nd anniversary of the Tiananmen Square crackdown. The event, organized by the Hong Kong Alliance, comes after the Chinese government's efforts to suppress anti-government protests. In response to an online campaign calling for protests in China, authorities deployed heavy security and tightened rules for foreign reporters. The Tiananmen Square protests began as a memorial for Hu Yaobang in 1989 but turned into a pro-democracy movement. On June 4, 1989, Chinese troops opened fire on protesters, resulting in hundreds of deaths. The victims' relatives continue to hope for a reversal of the verdict that the protests were a counter-revolutionary rebellion.
Iran has implemented a plan to cut subsidies on fuel and other essential items to boost its economy. The country aims to remove all subsidies within five years, starting with a four-fold increase in the price of subsidized gasoline from 1,000 rials (9 cents) to 4,000 rials per liter. This move is expected to help Iran save around $100 billion annually and make the most of its vast oil and gas reserves worth $13.5 trillion. The subsidy reforms aim to reduce domestic demand for fuel, increase fuel efficiency, and allow Iran to profit more from its natural resources. The decision has been recommended by international financial organizations and is seen as a necessary step to address Iran's economic woes despite its abundance of fuel resources.

Sudan and Chad have signed a non-aggression agreement to halt cross-border hostilities. The agreement was signed after nearly two days of talks in Dakar, Senegal, facilitated by Senegalese President Abdoulaye Wade and witnessed by UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon. The agreement aims to normalize relations between the two countries and prevent the cross-border movement of rebel factions. Both countries have accused each other of supporting armed groups that destabilize the government. The UN has been working to address the issue, with over 10,000 Darfur refugees living in eastern Chad and the region facing serious strain due to the large number of displaced people. The UN will work to ensure the countries carry out the terms of the agreement, which has been signed several times in the past but has not been successful in preventing renewed violence.

"Greek Prime Minister Kostas Karamanlis has called for early elections to be held on October 4, two years ahead of schedule. The move comes in response to pressure from the opposition Socialist Party, which threatened to block the election of a president in February unless a general election was held first. Karamanlis aims to gain a mandate for reforms to address the international financial crisis, which has led to economic challenges and recession in Greece. The reforms include stringent control on public spending, a ""war on tax-evasion,"" and bold structural reforms. Karamanlis' term was not due to expire until September 2011, but he agreed to the early elections after the Socialist Party leader, George Papandreou, insisted on new elections before the end of President Karolos Papoulias' term in February."

New York state has increased its cigarette tax by $1.60 per pack, making the total state tax $4.35 per pack. When combined with the city's municipal tax of $1.50 per pack, the total tax in New York City is $5.85 per pack. This drives the average local retail price up to nearly $11 per pack.

However, some smokers, including a 20-year smoker, plan to continue buying cigarettes despite the high prices. The Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids notes that New York has the highest state-local tax on tobacco in the country, surpassing Chicago's $3.66 per pack.

A Mexican radio station has aired a recording of a conversation between a federal congressman, Cesar Godoy, and Servando Gomez, the leader of the La Familia cartel.

He denies the accusations, calling them part of a smear campaign, and claims the government leaked the tapes to discredit him. The recording has renewed concerns about corruption in Mexico, where over 28,000 people have died in drug violence since 2006.
