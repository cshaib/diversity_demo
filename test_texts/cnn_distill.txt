Born in a shipyard worker's family, Zinn attended college and worked as a teacher before receiving a Ph.D. from Columbia University. His book ""A People's History of the United States"" sparked a documentary, ""The People Speak,"" which highlighted social change efforts from within the US. Zinn believed that social issues were often ignored in history, and he advocated for social change, particularly in foreign policy. Despite his lack of expectations, Zinn's legacy was a positive one, inspiring a recent documentary called ""Obama at One,"" which highlighted Obama's domestic policy decisions."
"A $80 million research project at the University of Leeds aims to give people 50 active years after the age of 50. The project, called 50 more years after 50, aims to ensure that people remain active and healthy throughout their old age. The goal is to replace worn-out body parts with new ones grown from own-grown tissues. This will allow for more durable implants and artificial hips, knees, and heart valves, which will last longer. The research is driven by the concept of ""50 more years after 50"" and aims to improve the quality of life of patients through more timely interventions, shorter hospital stays, and quicker recovery times."
A car bomb exploded outside a British army base in Northern Ireland's Holywood neighborhood early Monday, injuring one person. The blast occurred 30 minutes after police powers were transferred to Belfast from London. The taxi driver was held for almost two hours before being told to drive to the base. Security staff at the facility evacuated the area, and one elderly male sustained minor injuries. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack, but the Real IRA, a republican splinter group, admitted to being behind it. The incident highlights the ongoing tensions in Northern Ireland, where dissident Irish republicans have been blamed for recent attacks, including a car bomb explosion on January 8 that injured a Constable and a car bomb explosion on October 22 that injured a woman. The region has seen increased violence since the 1998 Good Friday agreement, which reduced violence but still left some pockets of violence.

A Turkish Airlines plane, Turkish 1951, crashed on February 25, killing 9 people and injuring over 60 others. The flight was carrying 146 passengers and 4 crew members. The pilot reported a faulty left altimeter, which caused the plane to behave in a manner similar to falling from a 700-meter altitude. The automatic pilot's throttles slowed the plane, causing it to lose speed, and the plane crashed less than 500 yards short of the runway. The Dutch Safety Board is investigating the incident, which may have been caused by a faulty meter reading.

This change is expected to boost economic activity and reduce confusion among businesses, as well as provide families with a dedicated day off. The law is expected to pass the Senate with a vote of 282-238."
The International Cricket Council (ICC) has dropped its investigation into allegations of match-fixing in a one-day match between England and Pakistan in September. The match, which took place at The Oval in London, did not feature three Pakistan players who are currently suspended after claims of spot-fixing.

"China has criticized Norway's decision to award Liu Xiaobo, a leading Chinese dissident, the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize. Liu, serving an 11-year prison term for inciting subversion of state power, is being praised for his efforts in promoting human rights and democratization in China. Ma Zhaoxu, China's foreign ministry spokesman, expressed disappointment and stated that the award ""will damage bilateral relations"" and show ""no respect for China's judicial system."" Liu's wife, Liu Xia, is currently under house arrest in Beijing and has been banned from speaking to friends or media. Ma believes that Liu's nomination is a mistake, particularly since China's political system is already reforming from the outside. The Nobel Peace Prize committee's decision is expected to influence how Liu's sentence is perceived in China."

President Ali Abdullah Saleh plans to return to Yemen following an investigation into his attempted assassination of former Prime Minister Jawad al-Maliki in June. The investigation is reportedly nearly complete, and Saleh plans to return to Yemen to face potential criminal prosecution.

Opposition members, including opposition billionaire Hamid al-Ahmar and military leader Ali Mohsen, accuse Saleh and his allies of planning the attack to avoid a political transition plan that would lead to his departure.
"Russian and South Ossetia leaders have denied news reports that a motorcade carrying President Mikheil Saakashvili and President Lech Kaczynski came under fire in Georgia's South Ossetia region on Sunday. The reports, made by ""unpredictable people,"" were ""a provocation"" aimed at destabilizing the region. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov called the incident a ""real provocation"" and accused the Georgian and Polish presidents of making false claims to justify their actions. The motorcade passed a checkpoint and there were no injuries, although some shots were fired from Russian-controlled territory. The dispute comes amid escalating tensions in the region, which has seen fighting between Russian and Georgian troops since August and a subsequent Russian campaign against South Ossetia."
South Africa has refused the Dalai Lama a visa to attend an international peace conference in Johannesburg. The decision was made due to South Africa's interest in maintaining a focus on the 2010 World Cup, which will be hosted in South Africa. The Dalai Lama, who fled China in 1959, would have been allowed to attend if he was included in the conference. The conference was scheduled to showcase South Africa's human-rights legacy, but the decision was seen as a mockery of the event by the Tibetan government in exile.
Heavy rainfall in Southern California caused widespread flooding and spawned a tornado warning in Fresno, California.

A recent report by the Pew Hispanic Center suggests that the number of illegal immigrants in the US has declined from a peak in 2007 to 2009, with 11.1 million unauthorized immigrants reported in March 2009. This decline is attributed to a 22% decline in the unauthorized Mexican population from 2007-2009. The decline in the unauthorized Mexican population is the first significant reversal in the growth of this population since the 1990s. The study also highlights the staying power of the unauthorized immigrant population, with an average of 150,000 new unauthorized immigrants arriving annually in 2009, compared to 500,000 in 2005.
"China's Supreme People's Court has announced plans to reduce the number of criminal executions in the country. Due to current realities and social security conditions, the court will focus on controlling the application of the death penalty by judicial organs. This means that death sentences will be given to those with a reason, and the court will tighten restrictions on the use of capital punishment. The number of executions will be reduced to a minimum, with the sentence of ""death penalty with reprieve"" used more often. The court will also review and possibly overturn death sentences if the crime is considered ""grave"" and ""social consequences"" are met. However, analysts remain skeptical that this move will lead to a significant reduction in executions, citing the ambiguity of the term ""grave social consequences."""
Arctic reindeer herders in northern Scandinavia are receiving satellite-based snow melt maps to help them assess the quality of snow and forage areas. The information, provided by the European Space Agency (ESA), can help herders determine where to forage and improve their reindeer husbandry.

The ICR is also collaborating with Kongsberg Satellite Services (KSAT) to provide similar data for Europe and Eurasia.
A large patch of oil, believed to be from BP's ruptured well, washed up on barrier islands off Alabama and Mississippi. The oil, which is reddish-brown and about 30-40 feet in length, has been moving towards the states' coasts, with some beaches already seeing protective booms in place. The spill, which began in late April, has affected over 200,000 acres of land and displaced thousands of Gulf Coast residents. Authorities, including the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), are investigating the environmental impact and response to the spill. While tar balls have been spotted, the oil itself is not believed to be from the BP well, and the spread of the oil is being attributed to rising tides and strong winds.
A dispute between West Ham and Sheffield United over Carlos Tevez's transfer from West Ham to Sheffield United has been resolved. West Ham and Sheffield United reached an out-of-court settlement, with West Ham paying Sheffield United an undisclosed compensation fee.

The government has proposed $410 million in funding for successful schools and programs to address bullying, with the goal of ending discrimination and promoting healthy environments for students.
An FBI webpage highlighted a comment from an unnamed senior agent stating that Mexico's drug cartels are more violent than al Qaeda. However, the FBI later clarified that the comment was based on the agent's observation of violence in certain areas of the Mexican border and not a statement of intent to compare the cartels to al Qaeda. The FBI believes the cartels are not as dangerous as al Qaeda due to their focus on smuggling rather than terrorism. This comment was made in reference to areas of Mexico where the cartels are engaged in violent tactics, such as the case of El Pozolero, a man who was reportedly killed in acid by a cartel member. The FBI believes the cartels' tactics are more complex than al Qaeda's, and that the comparison is apples-to-oranges.

The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is introducing new measures to streamline airport screening for airline pilots. Starting in July, pilots will be allowed to skip standard security screening by presenting their airline ID and other identification. Screeners will check the information against a secure, real-time airline crew member database. This change aims to reduce waste and improve security. The TSA will test the system at several airports and will implement it permanently in the fall. The change is expected to improve safety and efficiency, allowing pilots to focus on protecting the cockpit. Pilots have long argued that screening for restricted objects is unnecessary and can be done with bare hands. This decision is welcomed by the aviation industry, which wants to ensure a trusted partnership with the TSA.

Despite the incident, Mandelson stated he wanted to continue with his meeting and did not pursue charges against her. This is the second high-profile action by Plane Stupid, a group that opposes airport expansion and aviation-related climate change, in recent weeks."

In a Japanese-style response, Toyoda initially tried to be calm and collected, but after being questioned by lawmakers, he appeared to be ""shaken up"" and appeared to be struggling with his response. This clash of cultures is a characteristic of Japanese culture, where consensus building is considered key and leaders are often expected to be more deferential to the public. Toyoda's appearance before the committee may be seen as an attempt to address the public's concerns and resolve the issue, or it may be seen as a sign of weakness or embarrassment."
"The Chinese women's gymnastics team at the 2008 Summer Olympic Games in Beijing did not use underage athletes during the competition. The International Gymnastics Federation (IGF) has concluded its investigation after confirming the gymnasts' ages through official documents. The federation believes that the gymnasts' passports, identity cards, and household registers were incorrect, but they were allowed to compete based on their younger ages. This decision was made after widespread reports that gold medal winner He Kexin, 14, was only 14 years old. The issue came to light when a blogger, ""Stryde Hax,"" claimed to have uncovered evidence of the team's age through internet searches. The gymnasts' team, which won a gold medal, also included two younger girls, Dong Fangxiao and Yang Yun, who could potentially have an advantage due to their smaller bodies. The IGF plans to further investigate the situation."

According to CNN, over 1,000 American troops have been killed in Afghanistan since the start of the war in 2001, with the death toll increasing each year. The discrepancy in casualty rates between the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan is striking, with the US losing over 100 troops per year from 2001 to 2006 and over 300 troops per year from 2007 to 2010. Despite this, the US is working to establish a legitimate government in Afghanistan, targeting up to 1,000 Taliban fighters in Kandahar. The operation is expected to be a difficult one, with the US and its allies tightening security and targeting drug cartels and warlords, aiming to establish a secure government in the country.
China has refused nine US Navy ships and one Air Force jet entry to Hong Kong in the past month. The US Navy ships were denied permission to make a Christmas port call and a US Air Force C-17 flight was denied permission to enter Hong Kong. The reasons for the refusals are unclear, but officials believe it may be due to concerns about US arms sales to Taiwan or concerns about the US President's visit to Taiwan. The US Navy is seeking a clarification from China about the decisions. This incident occurred after China had previously denied US Navy ships safe harbor in Hong Kong during a storm. The US Navy is frustrated with China's decision-making process and is seeking a formal protest from China. The incident highlights the ongoing tensions between the US and China over military cooperation, with the US seeking to move forward on broader issues of military cooperation.

"A US federal appeals court has upheld a $413 million judgment against Syria, resulting from the murder of two American contractors, Olin ""Jack"" Armstrong and Jack Hensley, in Iraq in 2004. The court ruled that the families of the victims were entitled to hold Syria responsible for ""material support"" of al-Qaeda in Iraq.

In Morocco, single mothers are breaking records, with a recent study showing a significant increase in the number of unmarried mothers in 2009 to 27,200 compared to 11,016 in 2008. The majority of these mothers are young, often in vulnerable professions, and without a high school education. They are often forced to accept their partners' demands for marriage, and many feel trapped in marriages where they are unable to leave their children. Despite the country's modern advancements, prejudice against unwed mothers remains, and the number of these women assisted at the Center of Listening has increased significantly since the end of last year.

A new report by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has estimated that nearly one-fifth of the world's coral reefs could be wiped out in 30-40 years due to climate change, pollution, and invasive species. The report, compiled by 15 countries, warns that unless urgent action is taken, reefs in developed and developing countries could be completely wiped out by 2050. The main threats to coral reefs are climate change, overfishing, and pollution, which together account for about half of the total damage. However, a recent study by scientists at the World Maritime University in Malmo, Sweden, suggests that the actual number of reefs affected could be higher. The good news is that the overall number of reefs in good health has increased, and the hope is that damaged reefs can recover and adapt to environmental challenges.
A United Nations study found that Afghanistan's opium production dropped by 10% in 2009, down from 133,000 hectares (287,000 acres) to 69,833 hectares (172,561 acres). This decline is attributed to new aggressive drug-fighting tactics, including destroying poppy crops, and a shift in cultivation from opium to legal crops. The study also highlighted the importance of incentive programs, such as those run by the UN and NATO, to combat opium cultivation. However, some fear that drug traffickers are adapting and developing new tactics, including collaborating with corrupt government officials and terrorist groups, to continue producing and selling opium.

"Father Gabriele Amorth, the 85-year-old priest of the Roman Catholic Church, stated in an interview with CNN that people can be tempted by Satan and literally possessed by the devil. He believes this is the case with priests who have been accused of abusing children in Europe, where exorcisms are performed on suspected child molesters. Amorth, the founder of the International Association of Exorcists, has performed over 70,000 exorcisms and believes that priests who are tempted by the devil are not possessed by the devil. He emphasizes the need for priests to be converted and repentant, rather than performing exorcisms, to free themselves from the devil's influence. Despite the controversy surrounding the Vatican, Amorth remains optimistic about the church's overall health, stating that it is ""full of good people"" who are working to spread God's message."

"A large ice shelf in the Antarctic Peninsula is ""imminently"" breaking away from the mainland. Satellite images show new cracks in the Wilkins Ice Shelf, which connects to Charcot Island. The cracks are expanding and may be caused by global climate change. The ice shelf, which was previously stable, has lost 164 square miles (425 square kilometers) of ice in 2008 and is expected to lose more ice in the coming years. The loss is significant, but not enough to cause a rise in sea level. The ice shelf's stability has been described as ""immediate"" and ""unique"" among Antarctica's ice shelves.

A study by The Guardian newspaper found that Manchester United's English Premier League rivals, Manchester City, are unfairly receiving injury-time goals at the end of matches. The study found that on average, United's opponents are given over a minute of extra time, compared to when they are ahead. This is attributed to United's reputation for scoring late goals. In 48 games when United were in front, the average injury time was 191.35 seconds, while in 12 matches when they were losing, the average was 258.17 seconds. The discrepancy in injury time between the top four Premier League rivals is significant, with Manchester City's average of 179.29 seconds and Manchester United's 210.49 seconds.

According to the Lundberg Survey, US gas prices have decreased by nearly 33 cents in the past two weeks, reaching an average of $1.97 for self-serve gasoline and $2.93 for diesel. This is the first time since 2005 that gas prices have been below $2. The drop is attributed to a decrease in crude oil prices, reduced demand, and lower refining margins. While diesel prices did drop, they still remain high, with an average of $2.93 per gallon. The survey suggests that if crude oil prices do not drop further, the end of this gas price crash is likely near.
"Joseph McGinty Nichol, a prominent filmmaker, was a child in Kalamazoo, Michigan, in the 1980s, playing with toy robots. He decided to use real robots in his films, ""Terminator Salvation"" and ""The Taking of Pelham 123,"" which won several awards, including the Academy Award for best picture. The decision was deliberate, as McGinty believes the public can feel the difference between CGI and real objects. The use of real robots was a tribute to Winston, a special effects supervisor who passed away in filming. The cast members also expressed their admiration for Winston's work, emphasizing the importance of authenticity in their work."
New York State Assemblywoman Linda B. Rosenthal sponsored a bill requiring landlords to disclose bedbug infestation history to potential tenants.

"The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) in the UK is considering new rules to restrict the use of ""second generation"" rat poisons, also known as difenacoum and bromadiolone, within 16ft of buildings. However, pest control experts claim that these poisons are not ingested by other animals and only a fraction of the amount is ingested when errors are made. The HSE is concerned that predators, such as foxes and birds of prey, may consume the poisons if used correctly. This move could make it harder to control rats in parks and urban wasteland. The proposed ban, which would make 128,000 rat treatments illegal, is expected to make it harder to control rats in rural areas."

The United Nations' forest carbon scheme, known as REDD (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation), has been a focal point of negotiations at the Copenhagen Climate Talks. The program aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from deforestation and forest degradation in developing countries. Countries can earn rewards for conserving their forests, which can be used to boost incomes and protect biodiversity. However, critics argue that the program allows richer countries to meet their emissions obligations without reducing their own deforestation. The UNDP and FAO have proposed different models of the program, with varying degrees of success, to address these concerns. The negotiations aim to build on the progress made since the 1997 Kyoto Protocol and move forward to a more comprehensive solution.
