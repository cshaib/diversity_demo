"Peritoneal dialysis (PD) is a therapeutic option for acute renal failure (ARF) in developing countries, despite concerns about its adequacy. In a prospective randomized crossover trial, patients with mild to moderate hypercatabolic ARF were assigned to continuous equilibrating peritoneal dialysis (CEPD) and tidal peritoneal dialysis (TPD) therapy after an adequate washout period. The study compared solute clearances, potassium and phosphate clearances, dextrose absorption, and costs between the two treatments.

The study found that TPD resulted in higher clearances of solutes than CEPD, with higher creatinine and urea clearances. TPD and CEPD normalized creatinine clearances and Kt/V values were 68.5 +/- 4.43, 58.85 +/- 2.57, and 2.43 +/- 0.87, respectively. CEPD just fell short to meet the dialysis adequacy standard. However, both TPD and CEPD are reasonable options for mild-moderate hypercatabolic ARF. Kt/V appropriately estimates solute removal in PD.

In terms of protein loss, CEPD resulted in less protein loss, while TPD resulted in greater potassium and phosphate clearances, less dextrose absorption, and"
This article studies the use of recombinant urokinase (r-UK) for treating fibrinous occlusions in central venous access devices (CVADs) in cancer patients. The study is a phase III, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial that randomly assigns 50 patients with occluded CVADs to be treated with either r-UK or placebo. The primary outcome measure was the restoration of catheter function to withdraw and infuse through the catheter. The study found that low-dose r-UK can effectively restore function to occluded CVADs. The study concluded that low-dose r-UK can be an effective treatment for fibrinous occlusions in CVADs. The study also found that adding heparin to urokinase does not enhance the efficacy of the treatment but does not significantly enhance the treatment. The study concluded that low-dose r-UK can be an effective treatment for fibrinous occlusions in CVADs. The study found that adding heparin to r-UK does not significantly enhance the efficacy of the treatment but does not significantly enhance the treatment. The study found that low-dose r-UK can restore function to the majority of occluded catheters. The study found that adding heparin to r-UK does

"The available research suggests that folic acid, or its active form 5'-methyltetrahydrofolic acid (5'-MTHF), can significantly enhance the antidepressant effects of fluoxetine in women, while having no significant effect in men. This study included 127 patients with major depression, who were randomly assigned to receive either 500 microg of folic acid or an identical looking placebo in addition to 20 mg of fluoxetine daily. The researchers found that patients receiving folate showed a significant increase in plasma folate. Additionally, plasma homocysteine was significantly decreased in women by 20.6%, but there was no significant change in men. Overall, there was a significantly greater improvement in the fluoxetine plus folic acid group in women, with a percentage of 93.9% of women, who received the folic acid supplement, showing a good response (>50% reduction in score) compared to 61.1% of women who received placebo supplement (P<0.005).

A previous study found that 41% of 123 patients with acute psychiatric disorders (DSM III diagnosis of major depression or schizophrenia) had borderline or definite folate deficiency. These patients were part of a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of"
The evidence suggests that droperidol is an effective and fast-acting neuroleptic drug for the treatment of acute agitation in patients. In three studies, droperidol significantly reduced the need for further medication, such as haloperidol, compared to placebo. The side effect profile of droperidol appears to be favorable, as it was generally less sedating than haloperidol. Overall, droperidol appears to be a useful and safe option for the management of acute agitation in clinical settings. However, it is important to note that the evidence is based on a total of less than 500 patients, and larger, well-designed studies are needed to confirm these findings and establish the long-term safety and efficacy of droperidol.

"The study ""Ascertainment of an appropriate strategy of iron chelation for multi-transfused thalassemic children in developing countries"" is a prospective study that compares the effectiveness of desferrioxamine (DFX) and deferiprone (L1) for iron chelation in multi-transfused thalassemic children in a developing country setting. The study found that DFX is the most effective chelating drug in iron-overloaded thalassemic patients, with a significant difference between groups I and II, but no difference between groups I and group III in terms of mean urinary iron excretion. The study also found that DFX is more effective than L1 in reducing serum ferritin levels, but there is no significant difference in the reduction of liver and heart iron content.

The study ""Oral iron chelator 1,2-dimethyl-3-hydroxypyrid-4-one (L1) compared with subcutaneous desferrioxamine in 26 patients with transfusional iron overload"" compared the efficacy of oral L1 and subcutaneous DFX in 26 patients with transfusional iron overload. The study found that mean daily urinary iron excretion was lower during L1 than"
"This review summarizes three studies that compared the bronchodilator effects and safety of different inhalation devices for the administration of beta-2-agonists in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

1. Salbutamol delivered via three different devices: a dry-powder inhaler (DPI), a metered-dose inhaler (MDI) with a large-volume spacer and a jet nebulizer (NEB) in patients with stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
* The study compared the bronchodilator effects of salbutamol delivered via a DPI, a MDI with an InspirEase spacer, a Rotahaler inhaler, or a DeVilbiss 646 nebulizer (NEB)
* The 200-microgram dose of salbutamol produced a small but greater response in maximum forced expiratory volume (FEV1) and in area under the time-response curve (AUC-FEV1) when compared with placebo
* The 1,000-microgram dose of salbutamol produced similar improvements in both maximum FEV1 and AUC-FEV1 when compared with the NEB
* The bronchodilator effects"
This is the latest update on the mentioned study. In a retrospective study of a cohort of patients with low back pain (LBP), GPs have to provide radiographs more broadly, the number of patients with LBP who had a serious cause of their LBP was small, posing a time-consuming and of low yield task. In an earlier study, the diagnostic yield of lumbar spine films is low, but the diagnostic value of selective criteria for x-ray utilization is uncertain. The criteria for selective x-ray use were evaluated in a prospective study of 621 patients with low back pain (LBP) often prompts radiography, although the diagnostic yield of radiographic findings was over three-fifths of patients with LBP. The yield of radiographic findings was over three-fifths of patients with LBP. Application of selective criteria for x-ray utilization is uncertain. The criteria for selective x-ray use were evaluated in a prospective study of 621 patients with LBP presented with LBP. The yield of radiographic findings was over three-fifths of patients with LBP. The diagnostic yield of radiographic findings was over three-fifths of patients with LBP. The diagnostic yield of radiographic findings was over three-fifths of
"This study, which was published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2006, compared the outcomes of primary peritoneal drainage and laparotomy with bowel resection in preterm infants with perforated necrotizing enterocolitis. The study included 117 preterm infants with birth weights less than 1500 grams and perforated necrotizing enterocolitis at 15 pediatric centers. The primary outcome was survival at 90 days postoperatively. Secondary outcomes included dependence on parenteral nutrition 90 days postoperatively and length of hospital stay.
